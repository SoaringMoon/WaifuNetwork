I saw this cool looking interactive snake-bot. Thought some of you might enjoy it. Someday our waifus will cuddle us just like – no even better than – the robot in these videos.

Actually, good idea. We should be marketing the idea that robowaifus can be made into many forms, to suit all sorts of fetishes. We can make monstergirls real, at least to a degree. Get /monster/ and other boards on board with the robowaifu revolution. We need all the help we can get.

#monster_girls
This might be a good idea. Anyone feel like being an 'ambassador' of sorts and creating a _Robo Monster Girls_ thread there to promote this board and further interactions between us? This thread can in fact serve as ours.

Indeed. robosnekwaifus will be better than rather lamias due to their ability to cook properly.  

Don't get me wrong lamias are good girls too but those girls can't cook worth a damn. They can't taste anything! robowaifus would be able to response to their husband's taste and have artificial taste buds.  

Do any images exist of robosnekwaifus?

heh  

>Do any images exist of robosnekwaifus? 

don't know, i haven't looked for any personally. i know there are a number of robots now that are in a snake-like form (for crawling through pipes and rescue work, etc) so it would surprise me a bit if some anon decided to put a wig, makeup and a kawaii little dress on one tbh.
