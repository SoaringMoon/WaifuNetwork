# Tagging
Keep the tag block at the top of post below the heading for the post number.

# Images
We are no longer saving images in this database.

# Formatting
Do not use headings for any page that are not a post number, the files are already named.

It is not important that the posts stay numbered correctly, or even remain in the same order. They just need to be seperated.

Use proper titlecase for filenames and headings.

Obsidian will try to format pasted material, usually it does this very well. However you may need to manually edit content.

If a thread does not have a name, create one.

# Content Removal and Editing
Remove posts that contain no content related to Robowaifu design.

Please remove imageboard post links and quotes from posts. Quotes are typically duplicate information which does not need to be processed.

Feel free to edit the content and correct mispellings ala wikipedia.

If a link to content is dead, please highlight it.

Do not add posts that contain no useful information or discussion. This project is not meant to be an archive of an imageboard. It is a means of filtering  knowledge out of the content within it.

# Merging
Merge small threads with similar or related content to make searching easier.

# Special Pages
Special Pages begin with a `!` followed by a wod in all caps. These need special processing due to their size. Special Pages are usually temporary placeholder pages which will be demoted after their processing is complete.
