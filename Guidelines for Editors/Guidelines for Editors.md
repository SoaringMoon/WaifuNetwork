# Tagging
Keep the tag block at the top of post below the heading for the post number.

# Images
To keep the database small, please do not add images irrelavant to robowaifu design: including strictly meme images, frames of animation from animes, logos, or poor artwork.

Do not all placeholder OP images unless they are relevant to conversation.

# Formatting
Do not use headings for any page that are not a post number, the files are already named.

Use proper titlecase for filenames and headings.

Obsidian will try to format pasted material, usually it does this very well. However you may need to manually edit content.

If a thread does not have a name, create one.

# Content Removal and Editing
Remove posts that contain no content related to Robowaifu design.

Please remove imageboard post links or out of context quotes from posts.

Feel free to edit the content and correct mispellings ala wikipedia.

If a link to content is dead, please strike it through.

# Merging
