## Warning
WaifuNetwork contains data from the /robowaifu/ imageboard. Thus it may contain language or topics unsuitable for many people. We've opted to leave all of the data within uncensored initially, but it could be edited later to make it more digestable. We want to be a bastion for free speech and expression. Even if we don't agree with everything we read.

Thus, the views and opinions expressed in the WaifuNetwork repository is not that of the operators and editors. Content we don't like to hear is an aspect of personal liberty, and is a risk we accept using a information from anonymous sources.
