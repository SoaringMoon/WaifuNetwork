This is the Pandora thread where I hope to start a overall modular robowaifu framework over time. This is an open board project and collaboration is encouraged.

In my efforts to engineer a robowaifu, I'd found that going to a more robotic design would be faster and overall easier to engineer and assemble. For a start, I will post the progress of how far I've gotten on modeling Pandora before I begin the process of breaking everything down into printable parts and assembling functional prototypes. 

Had also changed her drones to have completely different functionality in my redesign, but that's fanfiction and not really relevant to the board. Engineering them is.

Had found a new technique to be very helpful in not overcomplicating my design. 

Also took a better look at her texture sheet to see that she has very simplified anime eyes, even compared to other members of her series.

YES! One thing I've learned through all this is that the luxury to start over is a real blessing. Make the most of it Anon! Cheers.

It doesn't seem like Kiwi is that interested in this thread. 

Had also hit a block for the last few days at modeling her hands and figured it was too soon to make any molds, so looked around for different problems I could solve like eye tracking mechanisms.

# 7
>>15454
I am deeply interested, just wish I had more progress to report. I do give my compliments to your model thus far. What is her intended height? Also, would there be any specific aspect of her engineering you'd like me to focus on?

# 8
>>15456
I would make her a few inches taller than madoka.mi thanks to her drone hat and shoes. 

Had seen how megaman legends implemented spinning wheels into their canon and was less complicated than I expected. Its basically a less complicated madoka.mi wheel design with a larger ascento leg design with smaller wheels near the heels of the shoes. Except it goes into a "ready" stance with one foot behind and one forward for balance to account for the larger mass of the torso.

Still have to model it lol but I do have my Pandora version designed in a similar style to my Kos-Mos.

That would be most helpful right now since you are already working with legs and as hilarious as it would be to see it fall face first, It would be great to have working breaks in the design so the mechanism doesn't crash, drag the shoes along and damage them in the process, or fall over.

Cool resource, Mechanum wheels are pretty cool. BTW, can we agree to her having an hour of active battery life? Trying to make 8 hours work requires crazy engineering that's highly dificult to translate into a low cost and easily manufactured design. Everything will be faster that way.

# 12
>>15492
1 hour would be fine. Just leave them plugged in for longer operational time since its not like they’d leave the work area anyway.

# 13
>>15497
I made more progress on her today. 

Remade her hair and used a bevel modifier to get a similar look to how they did the X Dive model upon further inspection of the reference model. Then I used that eye technique I discovered with Kos-mos and a similar color palette to her original design' for the eye texture. Still have to make her side bangs. 

Then kitbashed some shoes I made for one of my mecha with her because there's no reason to be modeling the same thing twice because its what I had in mind for her shoes. and blocked out most of her outfit. Still have further to go but she looks much better than my initial pass at madoka.mi so far.

# 14
>>15506
Great work AllieDev, I appreciate the effort to make her distinct. I would like for her ear drones to be made smaller as it would benefit her functionality as a reall robot. A smaller head in general would help but, I also understand the need to make her feel robotic and the moe appeal of a big head.

Over all, I think this model will make a good shell for the boards first mobile waifu. I drew up my idea for her skeletal system using an earlier model and human female anatomy. What are your thoughts on the design? It's very simplified but, I think it provides a good gist of the idea.

# 15
>>15508
Blocked out most of her staff today. Looks a lot more spooky than her original one.


>What are your thoughts on the design? It's very simplified but, I think it provides a good gist of the idea.

How will the mechanical tension be equalized in the center of mass so it does not fall over on its own? There's not much there to stop it from falling backwards.

The neck and arm sockets are also tiny even for a robot.

Spooky faded skeleton.

# 16
>>15515
They're all just quick placeholders. No dimension is known at the moment,  the head socket will be significantly larger. As for balance, the current plan is to localize much of her mass into her feet and hips. Aside from that, large reploid boots and a slight forward lean and slight crouch would also help.

# 17
>>15508
>A smaller head in general would help
Yep. If this design is going to be made into a real robot then that head is waaaay too big. Even if it will be mostly hollow. I also forsee problems with the big domes on the sides catching on her shoulders if her head is to be tiltable.

# 18
>>15522
I had drawn up some concept art on paper of that being an upgrade to make her look similar to her appearances in the games. Was thinking of a similar helmet to zero’s, which is much smaller and easier to model/assemble

# 19

Excellent advances AllieDev. Your ''Character Appeal'' for Pandora has really gone up!

# 20

AllieDev, I'd like to join your team and help out with ''Pandora Project''. You already can see my profile here (>>15496) for the ''MeidoCom'' project. Do you think there's something I can do to help you out at this stage of Pandora?

# 23
I iterated on several designs and decided on my own version of zero's helmet for Pandora as a default for her. Its far lighter and makes more sense for now as a base version like all the protagonists have in the games she appears in.

The forehead is a camera mount and its just not colorized with some hair to each side. Its what I imagined was inside the red lights on each reploid since even the enemy reploids have them but not faces and can see just fine.

Welcome aboard Chobitsu, Your Programming skills would be helpful at this stage for an interactive interface between the shell and a PC.


Do you know about "Monika After Story?"

I had similar features in mind with an expanded affection system. That project is open source with a github and wiki with everything written in Python and C++. 

It's essentially what I thought you had in mind with your Sumomo project, but with L2D compatible sprites without the limits of the ren'py engine that the developers and volunteers are adamant about. I just warn you that it is pozzed with pronoun shit and has been effectively dead for several years now with the occasional bugfix patch.

https://github.com/Monika-After-Story/MonikaModDev/releases/tag/v0.11.4

There were several fan projects that did incorporate L2D models and even an unofficial mobile port from some italian guy but were all abandoned shortly after they were completed and are years behind in updates and features.

Found unlocking the ability to ask her to go with you in a USB being tied to the affection system to be cute.

I might be able to start a project using Unreal as I've made complex UIs before. Would be obviously rough in a pre-alpha state, but with practice and a lot of learning, It could be done and would make more sense than the insane amount of resources MAS takes up that throttles computers. Nothing I've ever programmed in unreal had my computer sounding like an aircraft. Would be cool to have a procedural dungeon minigame in the vein of Megaman Legends, but "it is pending kill" is something I still haven't solved after giving damage and deleting an actor via custom function and its animation finished playing.

# 24
>>15573
I had even sketched out several bosses for it since megaman plays very similar to metroid. May as well make an homage to Prime. I didn't like Leviathan's original boss designs anyway.

Unreal does not have the same limitations that Ren'py has and MAS is mostly UI and some sprites with some custom persistent file coding and updates from the user's computer with a day/night cycle and random weather outside. Unreal does support multiple people working on the same project file remotely and a mix of visual scripting (what I am decent at) and raw C++ coding if you have Visual Studio installed. 

Could come up with a full skeleton list of features for V0.01 tommorrow if you are interested.

>Welcome aboard Chobitsu, Your Programming skills would be helpful at this stage for an interactive interface between the shell and a PC.
Thanks! I look forward to working with you on things AllieDev.

>Do you know about "Monika After Story?"
No. DDLC is very definitely ''not'' my kind of game so I wasn't even aware of MAS. I can try to make an effort to install it all and have a look at it in a couple of weeks or so when I put together a machine capable of running it.

However, I think it will be better and more efficient if you spell out in detail what you need me to do. 

Please be aware that building a big game or something is neither an inclination I have currently, nor do I have the time & energy to engage with. We have far too much on our plates trying to build robowaifus r/n ! :^)

I'm hoping to kind of work towards the details of making ''Pandora'' real ITT ?

>>15575
>Could come up with a full skeleton list of features for V0.01 tommorrow if you are interested.
Might be a good idea IMO.

# 26
>>15581
>MAS
MAS was a neat novelty mod and I'm not into those games either.  It has quite a lot of features and isnt a VN at all. Its like one of those tomagachis but with a waifu who can leave all together if you are gone for too long and is closer to a "dumb" robowaifu intellegence where its just pre-written dialog chosen at random according to the present moment and most of the interaction is user driven. 

From celebrating holidays and recognizing custom gifts to a very well implemented affection system that is capped at a certain amount each day and can go up/down depending on your actions and change her behavior towards you. 

Im sure this could be innovated on and adapted to a talking and moving robowaifu with our own work. Without an intelligence a robowaifu would just be a mannequin.

>back on topic

A simple status update interface would suffice for now with some test functions for basic diagnostics. Basic Sensors and segment locomotion tests like waving hello and blinking. Would be helpful to us all I am sure.

I don't know all of the parts that would be necessary for internals.

# 27
>>15592
OK, I think I understand. I'll try to have a machine going with MAS going on it within a couple weeks, and begin to familiarize myself with ''Monica''. Sounds interesting, actually. :^)

>A simple status update interface would suffice for now with some test functions for basic diagnostics. Basic Sensors and segment locomotion tests like waving hello and blinking. Would be helpful to us all I am sure.
If you recall my previous affirmation that a 'glass cockpit' (borrowed from the aerospace industry) would be a useful innovation for us all? Seems kind of like some of the need you are spelling out here?

If so then sure absolutely, I would be happy to work on this area for us.

# 28
>>15601
I blocked out a more printable outfit for her today and gave her a different hairstyle that made sense with the outfit's Zero theme mixed with my own.  Her hands were also just overinflated average anime hands that I repurposed from Madoka.mi to work here. 

Will also need to figure out a string mechanism for the fingers like in prosthetics. A solid hand works for now.

The megaman-styled shoes were also not as hard as I'd thought they would be and I still have to finish detailing the legs. With her design it feels best to have the wheels on the outer side of the shoes connected via a modeled in gap that I already put in there. Just like what was discussed earlier.

>>15601

Skeleton list of features for V0.01:

>test functions for both AI talk to speech and mechanism control
>This includes stating the date, time, weather, recognizing holidays, and overall serves as a debug test.
>typing interaction with the onboard AI. (being able to tell them your name, ask them questions, etc...)
>Device manager
>Optional updater

I know you are more focused on the physical model right now and don't care too much for the "game" aspect but what I meant by the Unreal project was being able to interact with the robowaifu when you are not home. Like Gatebox does with texts:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nkcKaNqfykg

Monika after story and its derivative fan mods also have minigames like instruments, tetris, chess, etc. They also have an effect on the affection system and have their own events. Would be important for a Robowaifu to be able to process events like that.

# 29

Good job with her design AllieDev. Definitely looks like she'll be easier to print and build now.

>Virtual waifu for on the go interaction
I do like this idea. Having a physical and a virtual waifu would have advantages. Definitely would need a way to synch both waifus safely so she remains one waifu with two forms.

I would presume you want to use the architectural framework we've been devising here on /robowaifu/, ''RW Foundations'', AllieDev? Basically every single point here is already being considered in that system of systems. Please clarify this for me, so I can understand if I need to work on entirely new derivatives, or we can use what's already gone before.

As to the UI & interactions, these sound like great points. I'd suggest (based on your answer to the above query) however, that we can do much, and much more ''efficiently'' by using things like the ''FLTK'' & ''OpenGL'', as needed. Hauling in a gigantic, 3rd-party, deeply globohomo-vestured engine system like ''Unreal'' doesn't strike me as a great idea TBH. Don't get me wrong, I'll work with your plans however you want to proceed here, but this is my initial basic advice to you on the matter.

>Virtual waifu/Gatebox/et all
Oh I'm right on board with you there Anon. Thus why we've begun the ''RW Chibitsu'' concept (and indeed the initial ''Sumomo's World!'' project itself). As Kiwi pointed safe-syncs will be vital, but I feel we're already > 50% of the way there towards that with the ''RW Dolldrops'' facility.

There's a world of possibilities with the basic idea itself to be sure!

May as well use those libraries for what they were intended to be used for. Would help to have some documentation on what each library is for and what features are within them. 

Raw C++ code is not a subject that I am strong in and visual scripting is what I am better at using since it helps bridge the gap between not knowing specifically what to use or look for and learn in the process.
You do have to learn the fundamentals to make anything work in Unreal and there is no shortcut to learning the node system as most other visual scripting platforms behave similarly yet have their own quirks and different names for each node. Like Unreal's Panner node and Blender's Mapping node.

>Erh nerh itz epic

Don't know about all the autism around epic and don't care since its the same group of perpetually upset bad actors who trawl for the ignorant and unwary. I would recommend everyone come to their own conclusions and not get too caught up in all that weaponized autism. 

I got what I was looking for in terms of hands on fundamental knowledge via visual scripting and moved forward. Epic did help create the UI and node system for Blender 2.8 onwards.

>What is pic rel?

In my research, I learned that capcom has new character animators make a Servbot because its a lot harder of a test than it appears at first glance getting all the proportions correct. Tried it out and made a small blender scene. Should probably have given him a hat or accessory as a side character, but it was cool to finally make proper face textures.

Sounds good. So, our plan in that case is simply to create a ''Pandora'' project inside RW Foundations, similar to the way we've created one for ''Sumomo''. We can focus the project development for this there and deliver it ITT in a way similar to the ''Sumomo Project'' thread. If this is agreeable (or not) please confirm for me.

Yep docs are important, and we definitely need an Anon **maybe one of our lurkers?** to step up and help out with that. I already provide rudimentary docs in the form of inline Javadocs, and ofc, the thread itself.

I'm going to be setting up a box for reading through ''MAS'' for this project already, maybe I can set up Unreal if it turns out we need to. However, now that RW Foundations is on the menu, I'm pretty sure your project will never need it.

I've already __'''''deeply'''''__ come to my conclusions regarding '''The Globohomo Big-Tech/Gov''', Anon. They are the enemies of all humanity, and doubly so for adventurous men such as ourselves trying to emancipate men from their feminism-stranglehold.

They would kill us all today, ''literally'', if they could get away with it. ''Le Epic'' is simply a powerful pawn in their hands--a golem of sorts if you will--and best avoided by us and by every man tbh.

Neat. Facial animation is a bit of a fascination for me. Once we reach a stage where I can invest a lot of time into that aspect, I plan to be a big part of that for ''Pandora'', ''MaidCom'', ''Sumomo's World!'', and indeed wherever it's needed.

Yes it is. I just don’t know how to implement assets via raw code like widget switchers for the different tabs. UI design is more on the fluff side but I found it more useful to skeleton out that first.

Rico’s anon was very generous and helpful in clearing up several misconceptions I had like bores in the shell for screws so those are no longer an issue.

Great! We'll move forward on that then. Probably the initial, empty 'skeleton' of code ~a week from now.
>I just don’t know how to implement assets via raw code like widget switchers for the different tabs. UI design is more on the fluff side but I found it more useful to skeleton out that first. 
FLTK, like most UI/Widget systems has an interactive designer tool. It's called ''FLUID'', and will probably get installed alongside if you use your distro's software repo for installs of FLTK itself. Their site has links as well.

My recommendation would basically be for you to sketch out UI mockups as images you post here. I can then simply 'paste' those images into the FLTK-based windows, and then gradually work each element into an actual live widget, little-by-little.

Start small, grow big. We can all get there together in due time Anon. :^)

Not sure I know precisely what you mean by the term 'Internals' ? Like specifics, instead of generalities please?

Probably a good design approach then, sounds like to me.

Outstanding idea. This will help everyone on the board to develop modularity to it's full extent.

That sounds to me like a good choice AllieDev. It's a design that's got a lot going for it. Do you know if it's permissively-licensed so that we here can freely use it?

I’ve watched some tutorials on it but wouldn’t hurt to ask for more resources. Just have to sketch up the draft since I already have the process in mind.

By internals I mean internal components like general electronics, gearboxes, stepper motors, joints, and electrical wiring to connect them all to a motherboard. 

Once I know all the basic components needed for more complex robots like humanoids, then integrating them is not as difficult. Had also seen an arm kit that was a good case study that I reviewed pictures and videos of for the general idea.

Also remember that programming mechanum wheels could be a frustrating endeavor but a worthwhile one.

I'm not too sure of any, I just started playing around with to figure it out. Today, I simply use it to figure out their API calling formats. My apologies I don't have anything to offer you beyond letting you know about the tool itself. Honestly, I simply suggest anyone who wants to learn it just play around with it.
>Just have to sketch up the draft since I already have the process in mind.
Sounds good then AllieDev. As I mentioned, I can just bit-by-bit work on transforming the widgets into realities, as we devise the back-end code and systems they call into for their states, control signals, & other data, etc.

>By internals I mean internal components like general electronics, gearboxes, stepper motors, joints, and electrical wiring to connect them all to a motherboard. 
Ah, I see got it. There's obviously no shortcuts to this. There are tons of resources and ideas already scattered around /robowaifu/ and even more resources and ideas out there elsewhere.

One of our challenges here is both the ''forest'', and the ''trees''. We have to balance both perspectives, especially here at this early stage of design even before prototyping begins. I'd suggest looking for ways to begin breaking the problems down step-by-step, then lather, rinse, repeat for each important (set of) component(s). Ideas like those contained in the ''Elepahnt Thread'' will help. (>>4143)

>Also remember that programming mechanum wheels could be a frustrating endeavor but a worthwhile one. 
How so? I'm not familiar yet with programming ''any'' kind of wheels, so at the very least I can go into it with no preconceptions. Should help a little at least.

>I do not know.
I see. Well, it would be a great help to us if they did, I presume. When things are permissively licensed, we can use them directly here on /robowaifu/. Otherwise, we cannot use them here on /robowaifu/.

Considering that they constantly spout off about diversity propaganda and use that as a selling point of their company, I'd say its not and that company is pozzed. 

However, it is not illegal to make our own distinctively different mechanisms using our own work. This is how there are thousands of different part manufacturers. 

>There's obviously no shortcuts to this

Had gotten up to data structures before in C++. What you shared with me was great as a glossary with some review lessons. 

Though I find the autistic insistence the majority of programming resources have on constantly throwing in new terms, variables, and operators at random without ever really explaining them and expecting you to just automatically know a brand new concept and everything you can ever do with the new terms and operators from now until the end of time before you've finished reading the sentence regardless of the yearly revisions to the language to be overwhelming and unrealistic at best, and maliciously placed disinformation at worst.

>I'm not familiar yet with programming any kind of wheels

For Mechanum wheels, Its all based on Wheel spin direction since there are no wheel axels at all. 

I was just sick of being the only person doing anything on this project before and felt that I may as well make my own omni wheels. For now I will stick to a generic design that I came up with on a whim and want to graduate to the cooler slanted versions that I was used to working with that are functionally the same thing.

Had also done some rough sketches of how the servos in the legs will work and made thicker lower legs for stability purposes but don't have everything polished enough to move to a physical prototyping phase. For now making functional assemblies should be my goal with rapid test prints. 


Still need to find a good tutorial on replacing the larger hot end fan and a good replacement flush cutter for cleaning up prints as the stock one only lasted me a year before the ends started chipping away.

I'd be inclined to think so yes. So-called 'liberalism' **heh, what an absolute abuse of the term :^)** seems to strongly favor ''no-fun-allowed'' as a fundamental principle. Wanting to control everything and everyone around them is a hallmark IMO.

Regardless,

Yep. Honestly I couldn't give much less of a flip about the 'legality' involved, I'm simply looking out for the interests of small businessmen who decide in the future to create robowaifus for the betterment of all mankind. Kiwi, for example. Encumbering work here with FUBAR'd licensing is a surefire dogwhistle for them to be attacked by feminists and their legislatory hangers-on in the future. No thanks.

OTOH, as you indicate, ''prior art'' is a strong combatant point against these types. I'm sure we could make some arguments in our favor going all the way back to Ancient Greek mythology haha! :^)

>Sepples
Cool. Well, as I indicated to Kiwi, if you're ever interested in actually pursuing it to the degree we here all need someone else besides me to do so, then __I'm__ an ''autistic programming 'resource''' who has nothing but your (and everyone else regular here) best interest in heart. AMA.

>Mechanum wheels
Ahh, I think I see what you mean now. There was a toy RC car posted here on the board that had something vaguely similar in design. Seems pretty cool tbh.

I look forward to seeing your sketches, and to working with you on ''Pandora'', AllieDev!

Same here, by and large. I'm speaking of professional C++ developers in gigs I've had. Since we are a generally serious-minded bunch largely focused on systems-oriented projects, we are usually helpful to other serious-minded individuals we come across.

Quite frankly, /robowaifu/'s ultimate goals easily qualify as one of the singularly largest & most complex set of systems-engineering challenges in all human history IMO. You can expect that there will be others of like mind joining in once they are convinced of our success.

>Was just referring to the books I've found on C++.  
Again, as I mentioned to Kiwi, ''Stroustrup's'' textbook is '''a''') second to none for the serious beginner, and '''b''') doesn't make any unsupported presuppositions on the reader. It's clearly focused on the complete neophyte, and clearly states so right up front. Plenty of hand-holding along the way. The downside of course is that makes the book quite thick! **1'300+ pages lol** (>>4895)

>Also looking into various robotics software to have a better idea of how to go about the GUI. Had found a workflow for it.

Quick question AllieDev. Do you have a specific preference for the name of the project in the code? 

We've been pretty much universally using the form of 
[code]RW Projectname[/code], such as 
'''''RW Sumomo''''' and '''''RW Bumpmaster'''''.

Following this form would naturally result in
[code]RW Pandora[/code] Now that's certainly not some kind of a necessity, it's simply a uniform idiom we've been using all along.

If you have a particular preference for how to specify your project's name please let me know thanks.

Great! So, here's the project's first drop (>>15723). As mentioned in that post, we'll be supporting all projects simultaneously, so we'll just keep making drops in ''that'' thread for RW Pandora stuff, and crosslink to them back here in ''this'' thread. Sound good?

While on my Travels I also thought of making Pandora Modular so it would be easier to customize her. 
Hence why I've also started a model of this Reploid here and an outfit themed around her for Pandora. Though her hair is a lot harder to model than Pandora's and blender was being screwy. 

Its great to improve at making a higher quality model and also nice to see that I'm not too far off from the official Capcom models at this point. They just have fancy texture work.
Next step will be actually adding more details to both this reploid and Pandora ZXR (>>15616) after testing out more techniques I've learned on this mesh.

>I am just wondering what half of these functions are supposed to do. Not the self explanatory ones but things like "hearsay" ,"dollhouse", and "gears" as usually pre-made components come with onboard software and drivers these days.
So, there's a couple of different things going on here.
1. We're primarily focused ATM on the computer science realm know as ''''Systems Architecture'''. That is, ''how do the different parts of the systems all 'talk' to each other effectively?'' This is very much a learn-as-you-go process for me personally. So far the approaches seem to be working fairly well, and it has definitely been quite helpful to work on a modest-sized but non-trivial application (''Bumpmaster'') to begin wringing things out thus.
2. As we have notions of where we want to go/things we want to do, we put in so-called 'stubs' to help crystallize the vision, and smoke out issues well beforehand. These classes you've mentioned are all currently in this classification. We'll be needing (in order of your mention)
-Voice recognition and Speech synthesis
-Docking, charging, storage & transport, and communications outside the robowaifu herself.
-A potentially huge variety of differing mechatronics systems, that all need an umbrella facility to work together.

And this last point is an important one: even if 3rd-party drivers, IDEs, apps, etc., exist already, we still need a ''unified architectural'' to ensure they all cooperate together effectively. Plus there is an unimaginably broad array of issues in allowing any Tom, Dick, & Harry to attempt to dictate what our robowaifu's systems should be doing at any given point. And add into that mess our enemy's '''''Pozzfest''''' to top it all off? Lol no, thanks. :^)

We need to maintain a high degree of specificity to the inter-systems behavior of our robowaifu's parts Anon. The ''RW Foundations'' systems are intended to accommodate this arrangement.

>Also find it funny how its like an actual obstacle course to get everything set up to even look at the code in the first place with the few programs and dependencies it requires.
>The readme was also hilarious and linux is a fucking wizard tier OS. Feels like you have to cast a magic spell and reclass as a mage knight just to get past the login screen lol.
>Now we descend into the tomb of madness. /s
Heh, UNIX is king of OSs pretty much today it's true. :^) As mentioned elsewhere, eventually we'll probably resort to a pared-down version of OpenBSD in the end, running custom user-space code written by us or our confederates. Other choices seem to leave much to be desired (and even ''this'' choice is a tough row to hoe). As always, we'll get there eventually if we just keep moving forward Anon.

>Pandora GUI
>Still working on it. Better to not miss anything critical early on. 
Good thinking. But trust me, I'm pretty flexible and more than once we've had to deal with me tableflipping.exe the work once I see more clearly into the heart of a matter. A more tortuous route, perhaps, but one that inevitably tends towards better and better solutions in the end.
>tl;dr
Don't worry about it bro. Just do what you think best and we'll all accommodate you in it as we can. You're calling the shots here!

>Setting up functionality to update the provided drivers for all available devices installed in Pandora but from a click of one button with confirmations inside the Pandora GUI should be a basic feature alongside troubleshooting options such as highlighting specific defective parts so you can safely replace them after the diagnostic is complete.

This is just a side study I did that I had thought was interesting: 

In my travels I found that a standard Geth platform seems like a very simplified "beginner's version" of a possible robowaifu since they don't have the complexities around human faces. Their developers said they were inspired by office lamps lol. 

So I had thought up my own idea of a geth platform based on Legion with its facial expressions after seeing an anon had posted a video of a robotic muscle lifting a small dumbbell with some assistance. The geth are mostly comprised of such synthetic musculature in their extremities. The movable face plates for expression along with the inner ring of the eye moving like a camera lens would be far less complicated than mimicking the musculature of a face. 

Byte's personality is that she is supposed to be fixated on discovering why organics enjoy food and the concept of taste since Geth programs do not require sustenance to survive. (OK, I'm done with the fanfiction now) 

Thought this would be great for a simple template personality in the pandora GUI as the voice leans more toward contemporary chatbots with a lot of reverb and is more of an emerging intelligence than a full fledged "person in a robot brain" that anime robowaifus are. 

There were also some animatronic videos I was researching and felt that the concept of a brachiosaurus animatronic neck is not too different than the significantly shorter geth neck.

It was an idea for templates in the program for different personalities and still wrapping my head around the internal structure for Pandora since I still haven't gotten much assistance on that end outside of finding all the answers on my own for mechanical problems.

Research -- including ''Design'' research -- can take a long time. Just keep moving forward with things Anon, we'll get there in time. If you want my advice then I'd say use the simplest forms you can and pare down anything not essential to the actual functionality of the systems. __Especially__ at this very early stage in the design & engineering effort for your project.

>For one: Bendable legs that allow her to stand on her own and won't just fall over.
I'd suggest the toy market for ideas on that specific goal AllieDev. They have to create products that are durable & 'autonomous' (so-to-speak). This necessitates lots of cleverness that IMO would serve us all on /robowaifu/ quite well, this project included naturally.

I would suggest adding elastic elements or using non-backdrivable geartrain on her leg joints if you want her to have static standing capability. Also, speaking of design concerns you're invited to join MaidCom or borrow ideas as we generate them.

Had been trying to overcome my hatred of mouse drawing and get better at drawing with it over the last week. Just drew whatever came to mind for Pandora and what I thought was a cool idea for swappable flesh colored casual wear parts since no remotely sane person wears battle armor cosplay all the time. Yes generic skin coloring is officially called "flesh" color by paint companies. It's weird. moving on.

Also been looking into making her hair pieces out of rubber-esque material via molds and attaching them via holes that fit into connectors and been looking into that since her robot hair does have a slight bend to it when moving or subjected to wind unlike the other characters. Just need to find a soft plastic material for it. Its more like what happens when lifting a plastic sheet and has the same kind of bend as that. Nothing too complicated.

Made some small changes to her model and am overall happy with she turned out. Could do with more definition on the leg armor and face but as I've said before, is on par with the current official capcom model of her imo as upon any scrutiny, she has a very simple original design. Just need to find a free CAD program now and break things down without blender's scaling fuckery.

Arduino seems to be what everyone, even here is recommending for robotics but no one ever just plugs the servo into the board in their videos and there’s some conflicting info when it comes to the power supply.

Would be great to have a built in calculator in Pandora’s software that determines maximum safe system voltage and the current system power usage to help avoid burning out components like I've seen happen here.

A Cute! You're actually getting pretty good at your mouse-paint skills AllieDev. Both pics have great character appeal (one of the foundational 12 principles of animation). Nice waifu for sure! :^)

I'm glad to see you thinking about soft parts for ''Pandora''. There are plenty of bits that should be soft, and IMO long hair is one of the most important. Cost is always a concern for us here on /robowaifu/ since our agenda is to enable men anywhere to build their own robowaifu companions. Wigs tend to be pretty expensive AFAICT (SophieDev can you tell us?), so devising some kind of sheet-like material for it is not only a common shortcut for 3D character designs, but it would also help with practical robowaifus as well IMO.

>Just need to find a soft plastic material for it. Its more like what happens when lifting a plastic sheet and has the same kind of bend as that. Nothing too complicated.
If you find something good, I hope you'll share it with us here Anon. Maybe the materials thread would have some ideas? (>>154) Please let us know if you figure things out.

She looks quite professional to my eye tbh. Your best work yet AllieDev! I'm really looking forward to seeing her prototyping begin. Any updates with your printers explorations yet? I'm sure once you are printing out practical shell pieces, she will become more and more 'real' to all of us here!

>Just need to find a free CAD program now and break things down without blender's scaling fuckery.
It's not perfect, but Blender's already amazing IMO. As Kywy mentioned, they are getting better in this area all the time (>>15973). Eventually (if Ton gets his way) Blender will be the 'do everything' DCC program even more than it is now. BTW, more than one Anon has been trying OpenSCAD (>>15976), and ofc SolveSpace has been a go-to choice here for quite some time. Maybe have a look at these two for starters Anon?

>Have you done any more coding on RW foundations since the beginning of the month?
Not really, there are many AFK things calling for attention. Some minor exploration sketches for ''RW Dollnet'' to re-use network connections instead of building up new ones for each dolldrop, etc., asset download.

>There is nothing pozzed about wanting Pandora's software to work with most widely available parts because they do have basic pre installed basic programming required to work in the first place via pulse modulation.
To be sure, the goal is to have literally hundreds of different boards, &tc. supported for our robowaifus in ''RW Foundations''. The issue for us isn't primarily about the degenerates devising things, but rather the privacy, safety, & security of both Anons and our robowaifus. It's a ''particularly'' very challenging part of the overall challenges we all face together here. :^)

Yes, it's an area our EEs need to focus on. Certainly we can tie their signal interfaces through the software out to the GUIs for C&C, and automated switching, warnings, &tc.

is just for parametric design, not for sculpting. The good thing about Blender seems to be, that it can do both. Though, the parametric part is rather new and might be under heavy development (I didn't try it yet).

is probably not good for making such nice colorful and shiny models with a lot of details. Using it for figurines or dolls seems to be something which no one ever really did in a huge and systematic way. So there are no tutorials how to do it the best way. Or I overlooked all of it.

NURBS are an interesting math 'technology'. They have been around since at least the 80s I think, and IIRC, Autodesk's literally-most-expensive product is "All NURBS, all the time".

Since the knots and hulls are, generally-speaking, fully-configurable (and scriptable too) then one might claim every package that provides them thus is in fact 'Parametric'.

I think the things that primarily differentiate Blender from say, 360, is the user interface to get at the parameters and tweak them in highly-convenient ways. Ton & Co. are well on the way however, and I expect Blender will in fact be near the top within a few year's time in this area as well.

I was referring to the technique how to work with a model. There's sculpting and parametric manipulation (changing values). Changing these values can be done with mouse and keyboard or in code. For all I know, Blender was for a long time using sculpting, not parametric design.

Still trying to level the bed so it doesn't drag the print off half way through the first layer with leveling programs. Common sense solutions like cleaning it don't work because the problem isn't the bed adhesion, its the nozzle being too far away from the bed particularly in the center right out of the box. So it gains enough filament behind it while moving and drags the first half of the initial layer off the plate every time. It can be a real PITA and I get sick of re-adjusting it via slip of paper under the nozzle after a few hours and then don't look at it for days at a time. Still haven't replaced the main cooling fan either since they want me to reverse engineer the power supply and/or destroy the wires for the main cooling fan while doing an autistic blood sacrifice at dusk and solder the ends to some connectors instead of just saying to unscrew the bloody thing and replace it like every other part of the machine, even the smaller fan, is able to be.

Had been looking into the ESP32 family of chips and the CAM chip looks like it would suffice for pandora's optical sensors with its camera module. Would like to find a source to buy them since I already have the microsd card I retained from madoka.mi. Just am concerned that few of the chips advertise "connected to the internet of things" with the same fervor you have for the idea of spreading robowaifus and a ton of reviews of defective chips and "incompatible camera" bugs. 

I have also not worked with servos for a while and do not remember how to connect them to the main board or know how to solder. So I dug up some resources and added them to the OP.

The Next objective after this would be figuring out audio sensors.

So far even dating back in the ancient pre-historical archives of 8/robowaifu it seems that nearly everyone seems to have a bottom-up approach to their projects, including me. How about working on the "brain" of Pandora? Do you have any ideas for that and any sensors or computer components we may need Chobitsu?

I did continue to brainstorm for parts and made a few 4komas for my Rebuilt Pandora's character I have to organize for demonstrating functionality. Also made a better reference piece for her summer clothes for when I get to modeling her swappable skin colored parts for warm weather.

OT:
**A weekly 4koma for the board's robowaifus would be funny as a community effort with its own thread but I don't believe anyone would really care for it outside of my own amusement. Sophie, Pandora, Rico, and Robowaifus of board's past and present would make an interesting enough premise.**

Count on some of them being bad. I toasted one when assembling Rico, cracked out my spare but the camera on it was DOA. (The rest of it works fine though, so if you buy a couple and one has a bad camera it could still be handy for other things)

You're probably looking for silicone. If you want stiffer check out castable urethane rubber. Check youtube for tutorials on how to mold and cast stuff.

See my diagram in the Reploid thread for a (incomplete!) example on how you could hook things up. For power supplies I'm using some dirt cheap buck converters that connect to an external 12V supply or, in the future, a battery. Use separate regulators for your electronics and motors, even if they both work on 5V.

Any AVR-based microelectronics is likely to be to the project's real benefit.

>Just am concerned that few of the chips advertise "connected to the internet of things"
Bad, bad, bad. :^) Ofc, in my design agendas for my own work the point is that no electronics whatsoever contained ''within'' (onboard) the robowaifu will be allowed to connect directly to the Internet. Ever.

Any devices found to be attempting to circumvent this ban and auto-connect on their own will be entirely disqualified from consideration for inclusion in any robowaifu manufacturing designs, period.

>I have also not worked with servos for a while and do not remember how to connect them to the main board or know how to solder. So I dug up some resources and added them to the OP.
Soldering's not too hard, but stay conscious of how much heat you're 'injecting' (by heat conduction) into the electronics. You can use clip-on little heat-sinks that will help with this.

Heh. I think that would be a fun 'extra-curricular' project AllieDev, I certainly approve the notion in general since we have a trustworthy bunch all working together here on /robowaifu/. Why not kick off a new thread with one?

>I don't know how I feel about the security on them though, maybe keep them off your main network.
The current network security paradigm ''du jour'' is moving to a 'assume every node/component is already compromised' mentality. This is a significant change (and a good one, finally). I certainly recommend such a conceptual approach for our ''own'' privacy, safety, & security goals -- particularly when it comes to network connectivity.

Tough challenges ahead though, doubtless.

>How about working on the "brain" of Pandora? 
Heh, hundreds of PhD theses have been spent already on the topic broadly, so it's plain to me this will be a big group effort for us to solve together. We'll very likely have to lean heavily on both prior-art and the literature to pull this off reasonably well.

OTOH, breakthroughs have often come by lone inventors satisfying the "Mother of Invention": ''necessity''.

I personally am much more a little like ''Michael Faraday'', than I am even remotely like ''James Clerk Maxwell''. Faraday was the final great Natural Philosopher in the Western Tradition, while Maxwell was very much cut from the modern scientific cloth. While Maxwell is greatly lauded by mathematicians, the simple fact is that Faraday invented the electric motor, and did much else important work in the field **:^)** ''without using maths at all''.

I'm sure most honest-to-goodness AI researchers would likely scoff at the simplistic notions laid out within ''RW Atashi'' thus far.
>
OTOH as you touch on, we're likely to succeed '''primarily''' by tackling things from the ground up. Breaking down various AI concerns into a highly-specified set of sub-modules, with plenty of tagging done by men, is reasonably likely to produce more rapid (if more narrow) general-use "Robowaifu Brain" results ''that will run very fast on hobbyist SBCs''. At least that's my studied opinion on the matter.

Regardless, we'll need to work together as a group to have a reasonable hope at succeeding with this endeavor. Everyone's input counts. We will already be working towards this yuge problem within the ''RW Foundations'' library itself over the years AllieDev. If you have specific ideas or requests please do let me know! Same for every anon here as well. :^)

>Do you have any ideas for that and any sensors or computer components we may need Chobitsu? 
Well, I've made some of my points for this area when I started our ''RW-OS'' thread roughly 2.5 years ago (>>201). While I've kind of expanded my views since then (primarily due to more and more narrowly-focused hardware being brought to market), in general I still feel just about the same way today.

Having mission-critical-style, redundant, fail-over, computation cores tucked safely away inside a robowaifu's ''breadbox'' is still the right way to go. After all, this is a highly safety-critical domain we're inventing here as we go along. Fortunately, we don't have to make such investments **small as they are, relatively** before proving out some of our basic ideas using lower-end, less-expensive approaches.

So, I'd say having a ''Beaglebone Blue'' or two (>>7824) would be a good starting point Anon. They're fairly powerful for the size & cost, and this variant has lots of robowaifu-beneficial additions we can capitalize on as well. Later on we can explore the ''Beowulf'' clusters, multi-computing, etc. 

For her eyes, I'd suggest starting off with a pair of ''Jevois'' cams (just the small ones, >>1110) since they can offload much of the visual computing problem directly onboard.

Cheers.

Y/w AllieDev. Can you more fully define 'main programming' and 'main board' for me please? In my own personal robowaifu design goals, ''only'' small computing (SBCs, microcontrollers, onboard mechatronics controls, basic electronics, etc.) will be used. So my recommendation for the BBBlue & Jevois were the intended computers I meant (along with a handful of likely-needed microcontrollers and power electronics). A small Chromebook-like notebook could be used as well if desired.

>I have found some resources that will help the building process of Pandora. 
Great! Thanks for all the description texts as well Anon, that helps.

>Microcontrollers...would be useful
Definitely. Using Anon's '''''IPCNet''''' concepts (>>2418), one should be able to securely network together all the computing (and most of the electronics) in a mobile 'Robowaifu Net' onboard. MCs can offload things like signalling actuators to move, polling the specified joint's actual angle, and interfacing with electronic sensors of various types (voltage, thermal, stress & pressure, rotations & transforms, etc.) You can think of them basically like smol, focused-use computers.

>Hair
I'm sure you'll figure it out. Hey, it doesn't have to all be perfect you know! :^)
**__particularly__ right out of the gate...**

>I didn't invent concept of the geth, bioware did.
Heh, nice. The IRL ''Beowulf'' systems were devised at NASA by an MIT grad & Co.
https://beowulf.org/overview/history.html
If you have a 2 or 3 old boxes laying around, why not try getting your feet wet with it Anon? Can't hurt.
https://www-users.cs.york.ac.uk/~mjf/pi_cluster/src/Building_a_simple_Beowulf_cluster.html

The primary reason for using them in my concepts for the RW-OS/Braincluster isn't about computation power (a single one of the pro Jevois cams would ''far'' outstrip a 16-Pi cluster in raw TFLOPS, for instance), it's about fail-safety (failover). To wit, the cluster '''itself''' is the main point.

>...She only really needs 1 camera sensor. Would be way easier to program too.
Fair enough. Besides, /monster/ **might actually ''want'' a cyclops robowaifu haha. :^)**

OTOH, Stereoscopic ranging is always a possibility with at least two. OTOOH, there are different 3D cameras w/ the capability already engineered in. Maybe we can figure out ones that won't try to violate our privacy at the same time, who knows?

>one should be able to securely network together all the computing (and most of the electronics) in a mobile 'Robowaifu Net' onboard.
Look into industrial communication protocols, they have this figured out. I remember a certain humanoid robot used an EtherCAT network for all its joints. The Innfos SCA actuators use CAN bus. Unfortunately, I don't think the extra hardware and overhead required to put every major component on a universal bus will be feasible to install on a slender (and cheap-ish) fembot. CAN bus would require tranceiver modules on every component. Ethernet based protocols would require supporting microcontrollers + PHYs on all "low power" (non SBC) components, plus an Ethernet switch to connect everything.

I don't think we need such a robust network setup. Your robot is almost certainly going to be controlled by a single master computer that everything else connects to (one to many), unlike a car or industrial system where multiple independent systems may communicate to any specific I/O module or sensor (many to many). The best system bus for a robowaifu may very well be plain old USB.

# 76
>>16051
Thanks for the good advice, RiCOdev. :^)

Yep, we've had a few discussions along these lines before, notably in our ''Power & Control'' thread (>>11018). We've also highlighted the abundant corollaries with the upcoming Robowaifu industries and the existing Automotive industries in our ''Self-driving cars'' thread (>>112). In that thread we posted a copy of the freely-available ''The Car Hacker's Handbook'' (>>772) which details many of the topics you mention in very a specific technical manner.

Like any other major engineering effort that spans years of time and multiple design and engineering teams, we'll undoubtedly see '''''Robowaifus''''' released in various ''blocks'', including relatively-rudimentary ones here in the beginning, all the way up to the 'sky-hifi-syfy' versions in the future decades. Manufacturing thousands of them is definitely on the plate for a few of us here, and professional engineering will certainly be a big part of that process.

While, again, I appreciate all the good advice yet with all due respect our future high-end robowaifus will be one of the most complex systems-engineering endeavors in all human history. They will undoubtedly make the highest-end automotive engineering from say BMW, Ferrari, Mercedes Benz and other top marques look relatively simplistic in comparison.

It will be an amazing thing to watch. And to literally '''''participate''''' and be a part of it? Priceless. :^)

>The same sites that sell ESP32's also offer a pre-soldered pins option for a little more.
Yeah absolutely. IMO we should definitely 'front-load' as many of the manufacturing tasks as possible, particularly in this very early prototyping phase (that is, ''today''). Not only is it easier to deal with for the Anons we're trying to serve here from our board, but it's also less likely to result in buggy systems. Good thinking, Anon.

>The main programming is her personality and being able to talk and move on her own with a self improvement directive and learn enough to converse as a smart AI would eventually. I am not strong in programming and do not know the more technical side of that subject.
>It is apparently not as difficult to make a robot that can walk around on its own and state basic things like what clothing they want to wear to start with as we had imagined.
Actually, this entire domain is a highly, highly complicated area Anon. Probably /robowaifu/'s single biggest challenge, in fact. Certainly we aren't going to arrive at an effective solution for the vast array of needs in this area overnight.

Men are making great progress with the statistically-based problems in pattern recognition, and ofc we're going to greatly benefit here by all their work. In fact we have some quite top-flight anons here on the board working on practical solutions for us using these approaches.

However from my long-term perspective, we're ''effectively'' seeking for a solution to the quest for '''AGI/Super AI''' here. Plainly we're a long way off yet (as all men working on this generally I mean, not just our board.) And our own challenges in this endeavor are exacerbated by the fact that we don't have multi-decade, ''national defense budget''-tier financing available to us. Multiply that by our needs to run our robowaifus ''on relatively simple, cheap, and low-power computing hardware too'', and I hope you can see where I'm coming from AllieDev.

True, we can create many kinds of stand-in proxies for the human intellect for our robowaifus (canned behaviors, lots of expert-system pick lists, etc., etc., etc.) and we will ofc do so. In fact ATM, it's our only real practical way forward IMO. But we're all going to be required to exercise a great degree of creativity and inventiveness rarely seen.

Now please don't misunderstand me, I'm not trying to discourage any anon here from moving forward -- far from it haha **(after all, I __still__ started /robowaifu/ knowing all these facts full-well in advance)** :^). But just like ''Puddleglum'', '''''"I always like to know the worst of things right up front, then to put a bold face on it."''''' :DDD

>I was basically asking how they got all the servos on to a smaller board for each limb that has enough servo slots and in turn connects to the main board. Also want to know what to look for in servo cable extensions.
I don't have some special made board to fit in the arms or anything like that (thought that would be cool!). The only thing I do in the arms is tie together each servo's power and ground lines so there's less cable mass to deal with. The cables are routed through a small hole inside the first arm joint, then through a cable management loop in the body's internal frame (behind) before reaching the vreg and pwm board. I actually used the pwm board's "V+" rail as my 12V rail, as each group of servos connects to its own voltage regulator anyways. You can see I tried to tidy it up with some zap straps but it's still a big mess.

You don't need a magic cable for RC servos. Solder 3 .10 in headers to 3 wires and bob's your uncle. The female connectors bog standard too, sometimes they're called "dupont connectors".

So for an update for you, we made another Caturday drop this weekend (>>16119). R/n the main focus is still getting all the various needs for Bumpmaster and safe & secure networking/sneakernet info transfer for our robowaifus working. Every single robowaifu that uses the ''RW Foundations'' systems will benefit from this, including ''Pandora'' ofc. 

BTW, I wondered what you and Kywy + RiCOdev thought of the Sukabu piece I posted along with that one? I thought it's a nice design even if the eyes didn't suit my tastes personally.

# 83
How's things going AllieDev? Haven't seemed to heard from you in a couple weeks or so. Hope you're OK, friend.

So, we're not making a drop this week (>>16236) so I don't have any real update for you. We're hoping to simplify building the networked projects like ''Bumpmaster'' and ''Curator''. I think we'll manage it.

Please let us all know how things are going with Pandora, Anon. I'm personally interested to see how your Blender GUI prototyping is going.

I am still polishing up my GUI renders and they are just a proof of concept. Had tried to make a functional mock up in UE5 for the hell of it and Epic's new UI was unusable as many tabs were constantly closing themselves on their own even as I was using them. 

I'd also been working fleshing out Pandora's Software on paper and had felt there was little sense in coming back here every day empty handed. Should have something to show this weekend.

Was also disappointed how barebones the coding on Pandora seemed until I took a look at sumomo and the other libraries in the caturday drops. From what I had seen, it was a little more than some placeholders as copy of sumomo for now. What did you have in mind for features you wanted to add for Pandora?

>I look forward to what you have in mind for Pandora.
You're the team leader for the project AllieDev. I'll try to help out as I may. So, if you're asking for my advice then I would say basically that:
A) We need to stay as nearly compatible with the ''MaidCom'' project as is feasible with ''Pandora's'' design allows.
B) We need to keep ''everything'' (designs, mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, sensors & computer hardware, software goals, etc., etc.) as '''small & simple & cheap''' as possible during this first prototyping attempt. After all, it's important to make something that '''''just werks''''' first, then we can blue-sky later as we go along, right Anon?

That's pretty much it from my current perspective. If we can just follow these two basic goals, then we are very likely to succeed with Pandora right out of the gate. I pray we do so! :^)

===

As far as specifics relating to our software goals go, we're already working towards general-purpose solutions under the umbrella of the ''RW Foundations'' framework, as you're aware. Now the ''RW Pandora'' sub-project 'inherits' the vast bulk of her abilities from the ''RW Arigato'''s main project. This is the same for __all__ robowaifus that choose to adopt the Foundations in their system's designs. ''Sumomo'' & ''Kotoko'' for example, also indirectly inherit all their abilities from RW Arigato.

Longer term, Arigato has many different capability goals on tap. Here's the current listing of member classes:
>arigato.hpp snippet
[code]  inline auto animeyes() const -> Animeyes& { return animeyes_; }
  inline auto atashi() const -> Atashi& { return atashi_; }
  inline auto bones() const -> Bones& { return bones_; }
  inline auto curator() const -> Curator& { return curator_; }
  inline auto dollhouse() const -> Dollhouse& { return dollhouse_; }
  inline auto electro() const -> Electro& { return electro_; }
  inline auto face() const -> Face& { return face_; }
  inline auto gears() const -> Gears& { return gears_; }
  inline auto hand() const -> Hand& { return hand_; }
  inline auto hearsay() const -> Hearsay& { return hearsay_; }
  inline auto meido() const -> Meido& { return meido_; }
  inline auto shell() const -> Shell& { return shell_; }[/code]
Without digging in too deeply in this one post, hopefully RW Arigato's basic member classes' brief descriptions help clarify the overview a bit for you:
''RW Animeyes'' - '''"Vision & Object Detection Library"'''
''RW Atashi'' - '''"Cognition, Self, Personification, and 'Theory of Mind' Library"'''
''RW Bones'' - '''"Skeletal, Structural, and Components Systems Library"'''
''RW Curator'' - '''"Search, Information, and Data Storage, Retrieval, & Optimizations Library"'''
''RW Dollhouse'' - '''"Docking, Charging-System, Storage, and General Outboard Systems Library"'''
''RW Electro'' - '''"Digital & Electronics, Power, and Sensors Library"'''
''RW Face'' - '''"Robowaifu Facial Control & Expressions Library"'''
''RW Gears'' - '''"Actuators, Controls, and Mechatronics Library"'''
''RW Hand'' - '''"Robowaifu Hand Control & Manipulations Library"'''
''RW Hearsay'' - '''"Speech Recognition & Synthesis Library"'''
''RW Meido'' - '''"Household Domestics: Cooking, Cleaning, &tc. Library"'''
''RW Shell'' - '''"Robowaifu Shell, and General Inboard Systems Library"'''
-additionally, b/c of Pandora's GUI system, she also has her own Graphicom member:
''RW Graphicom'' - '''"Graphics & GUI Library"'''

As you can see Anon, ''"we're a full-service shop"'' here on /robowaifu/ . :^)

Obviously this will take some time to complete all these libraries, and there's plainly many other things that an IRL robowaifu is going to need. Again, ''start small, grow big''.

I hope that kickstarts our convo here AllieDev, cheers.
