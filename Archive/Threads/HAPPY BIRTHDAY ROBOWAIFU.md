==''5th Birthday Edition'' greeting here:==
(>>14499)

Well it's Thanksgiving time again and that means it's /robowaifu/s birthday time too.

It's been ~~3~~ full years since we began, and this last one has been a bit of a ride tbh. With the deplatforming of 8ch all of us who had communities there were mostly left out in the cold. Thankfully we've been given a new home here in our ~~bunker~~home at ~~Julay~~nuJulay, and a few of us have found our way back together here. Hopefully the rest of us will find Julay, and /robowaifu/ again as well. We've also made some new friends since we've been here, and I think we're in pretty good shape all things considered. 

On the topic of deplatforming, we have a new archival system in action that keeps a copy of the board up to date on my machine. Note that my original intent was to fully automate the archive.today archives, but it hasn't worked properly (they seem to be fighting against bots pretty hard now). I hope at least one other of you will also join in for the approach that's actually working, and use BUMP to keep at least one other copy of /robowaifu/ safe in addition to my own.

You never know what might happen to my gear (or even to me), and it's just smart thinking to have at least two of us keeping this board safe. My intent is to finish up the system for board migrations (along with Robi), and then bring over other things from the old files and get this board in shape again. Then we can keep it fully backed up together. As you regulars know, /robowaifu/ is basically unique among imageboards and well-deserves preservation IMO. Any other takers for doing backups as well? I just use a cronjob and it's all fully automatic daily I never have to touch it. I'll explain everything in detail how to do it if anyone else wants to participate. One other thing; should anything ever happen to Julay, just regroup on ~~Fatchan~~Anoncafe in our bunker-bunker there. 

Actually, I'm pretty upbeat about both the world of IB communities in general, and our own /robowaifu/ in particular. We all took a hard knock a few months ago, but we're back on our feet and in the fight again. Kudos in particular to both Julay and Smug for their innovations with the webring introduction. It's lent a resilience to the underlying systems for all our various communities that we've never had before afaict. This alone should help to ensure we have a long future of shitposting together anons.

Anyway moving on, I hope this coming year will also see a resurgence in everyone's posts here about their personal projects. I intend to do so myself. It's always a pleasure to see Anon's efforts and blog-posts about their current attempts and ideas, regardless whether they are successes or failures. '''__Persistence__''' is really the single most important factor for eventual success--even more than innate talent--and so just don't quit anon! Don't be afraid to get back in the game even if you met with failure before. Try something different this time, right?

Industry-wise, I think that most predictions about the ever-increasing pace of technological innovations in the areas pertinent to robowaifu production are on track. I believe this will eventually also translate into much cheaper components and other resources that we all need for our projects. AI is gradually improving and becoming more accessible for the budding software engineers among us (and the old hands too). 3D printing is still improving and becoming more widespread and a bit cheaper in general. Mechanism designs are slowly becoming better suited to cheap production techniques. Electronics of all sorts keep getting better. Materials science breakthroughs also pop up occasionally.

I hope this will be a great year for all of us, and that we each can find some work, project or ideas here that we will all agree on and can get behind together as a team. When we work together, we can be assured of progress--and then eventual success. Let's stay focused and make our dreams become real during this 4th year together.

We can do it /robowaifu/, you have some amazing ideas!

I'm looking forward to working on some cool ideas this year. I want to create tools that anons can use to further their dreams of synthetic companionship, and knowing that there are so many of us all striving to reach the same goal gives me the drive I need to carry on working. Happy anniversary, /robowaifu/, and here's to many more!

# 4
I'd like to invest in a decent 3D printer soon that can do nylon carbon-fiber. Cheap ones only do PLA so I'm a bit hesitant to blow half my budget for a good one and not have enough money for parts. In the meantime I've started designing a robowaifu that I'm gonna put together in Blender with all the artificial muscles, joints, bones and whatnot, ready to be printed. I was playing with Kizuna Ai's model a bit today and realized it's gonna be hard as fuck to design something with a full range of motion that looks good and doesn't cost a fortune to build. A simple shoulder is going to cost well over $500 unless I manufacture my own muscles.

I doubt my model will be usable for much but I think it'll be a fun place to start and learn what actually goes into building a robowaifu. If I fail, I'll just dismantle her, create an assembly instruction booklet, and ship her to a good home with a new fleshlight included to recuperate the costs.

Hopefully we can start making some physical progress this year. We've gathered a ton of information already. It use to seem like an impossibly complex task to build a robowaifu but every month it seems more and more possible.

Thank you for bringing /robowaifu/ back from the dead. May we all be blessed with waifus and electric love.

You don't have to spend all that money on expensive high temperature filament to get extra strength.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iICk_ZpY4Cs
And same thing with the printer itself all you need is a heated chamber  combined with an enclosure and a hotend that can handle the heat, most cheap printers can be modified to do this at much lower cost than buying a high temperature printer.

I've been researching 3d printers for years now and almost pulled the trigger on purchasing one several times. I'm probably going to go with a basic Anycubic Kossel Linear model which will cost more in extras for upgrades than the printer itself.

I hate to say it but reddit seems to be the best source of information for 3d printing whether it's news, modifications, buying or troubleshooting.
https://old.reddit.com/r/3Dprinting/

I also hope to be posting my results on here in the upcoming year.

# 6
>>1630
Neat, I had no idea a heated chamber was necessary and the cheaper ones could be modified to do it. That'll save a lot of money if I can just tinfoil it and get a hardened steel nozzle. Filling the parts seems like too much work for the amount I'm gonna be printing and I need to make the parts lightweight. If I was going for a house robowaifu I wouldn't mind PLA but I want her to be able use power tools, build houses and lift other robots.

Might as well post your progress too. This board is slow as fuck. I'm not even sure if I'm modeling this right. It'd be nice if there was a progress thread where we can get feedback.

# 7
Thanks for the sentiments anons, much appreciated. I have a feeling this will be a good year for /robowaifu/

Now, let's all get busy and work hard together towards our goals!

# 8
Happy Thanksgiving again, /robowaifu/. This weekend marks the end of our 4th year, and the start of our next one. Happy Birthday!

Wow, what a year this has been. No need for me to detail anything other than the continuing recovery and growing prosperity of this board. In fact, by many objective measures we're better off now than we've ever been and every indication is we will soon be/are moving into a more powerful realm than before.

'''-The board itself'''
Thanks to Robi and his backers for continuing to keep this place afloat and to graciously host us here alongside their own forum. That has taken some doing on their part, you can be certain. We now have both a bunker, and a bunker-bunker as well. Archives are being kept current daily. Quite frankly we are in a much more robust position than we were before the sudden migration here. We now have the early beginnings of a topical index (started just today) >>7143 . I anticipate this will help everyone, newcomers and old hands alike, to navigate the complex topics we're addressing here on /robowaifu/. We have more and more interesting and new information coming in at least weekly now.

'''-AI chatbots, voice-synth'''
Thanks primarily to ''Kokubunji'', we now have effective implementations of both AI chatbots (Talk2Waifu), and very impressive voice-synthesis (WaifuSynth) to go along with it this year. Along with the other utilities and research he has done here, he has really distinguished himself as a top scholar and waifuist, and deserves much honor by us on /robowaifu/. We also have at least 2 other AI researchers here as well now, and the entire field is becoming increasingly more accessible to us all thanks to everyone's efforts.

'''-Practical robowaifu prototypes'''
While we seem to have lost many of our other anons from before who were working on their own personal projects, we have been joined this year by ''Robowaifu Enthusiast''-anon who is sharing the nice progress on his wonderful robowaifu project ''Elfdroid Sophie''. She is already coming along very nicely and we're sure she will be even more appealing as time goes on. He deserves recognition both for his progress with her so far, and for his frequent other engagements here on /robowaifu/. He has already distinguished himself as a real team-player here.

'''-New visitors and Anons'''
We have been seeing a marked uptick in the number of first-time posters on /robowaifu/ during this past year despite the turmoil of everything else that's been going on. I consider this a good sign that our shared group vision of "ever-increasing demand for robowaifus by men everywhere" is not only a reality, but is a growing movement as word continues to get out and the idea spreads. I would suggest everyone work hard with their own focus' and projects, because at some point we're going to see the dam burst, and a sudden flood of newcomers will be finding out about this place and will arrive here wanting to know where they can get their own robowaifus. Some will come here to stay and actually help us out ofc.

So, we're in pretty good shape overall. I suggest everyone keep communicating with each other, keep sharing and open-sourcing ideas and cross-pollinating them, keep encouraging one another motivationally, and keep making this board a welcoming place for newcomers.

Here's to a '''great''' 5th year for /robowaifu/. Happy birthday to her!

>4th birthday edition
>It's been 3 full years since we began
Hmm, I'm I confused or did you get it wrong? It's the 3rd birthday then, or not? When talking about in which century we are, then you use the number of what we're in, but in terms of age it's the years passed by, not the year which we're in now.

>>1629
Buy a cheap printer, not one which can do carbon fibers. You can buy that one later, when you have more money and need it. You can add fibers to the outside, with glue or resin, or put metal parts into your plastics. We have a thread for 3D printing, with infos on that >>94.
I'm glad that you have that much enthusiasm and optimism, but I'm skeptical about being able to design your waifu, including muscles, in Blender and then print her. Good look, but make sure you can adapt your plans to difficulties you might run into.

Try building a trophy wive first, sitting on the sofa all day or dancing while holding a pole, then a housewife, then a mother or nanny, and then you can try building Cameron or Alita. Tools will be cheaper then, and you'll have probably more money.

I'm definitely interested in helping backup /robowaifu/. I've never made a backup of an entire imageboard before though (just copied a couple dozen gig of photos and documents onto M-Disc and external HDD). I'm a total noob, but willing to learn tho. BUMP? Is that the "BUMP CLI command line backup utility" I can see on Github that I must download and install onto a Linux distro?

Haha, someone put it up on Github huh? Yes, I'm the author of ''BUMP'', and yes, it's what I use. I'll push my current version as a zip onto catbox sometime soon and I'll walk you through the process in our /meta2 thread Anon.

My reasons for choosing a delta have to do with a rather pie in the sky idea of having it double as a traveling wire electrical discharge machining CNC machine. The guy who runs the AvE youtube channel tried making a similar project awhile back but gave up on it.

For most people delta style of printers are a terrible choice, the only benefits are slightly faster print speeds and and a taller print area. Nowadays the conveyor belt bed system for tilted 3d printers has made printing long objects such as arms or legs a non issue.

What a sexy description! **Seriously, some of us probably consider ourselves feminist--for whatever value of the word (if any) excludes the androphobic nutters--we just get off on sharing our men with other women.

# 33
I'm actually looking for a Happy New Year for 2021 thread, but as of the time of this writing, there isn't one, so I'm posting here instead as the theme is sorta similar -- what can we expect in the coming year?

In my case, since I really want to have a successful project this year, I'm approaching from a different angle -- that of hobby grade RC.  I only got into hobby grade RC very recently... before my experience was only toy grade.  I just couldn't stomach spending on a single chassis or fuselage more money than what a decent 3D printer would cost, until I realized there is so much in the RC community that can be applied to robotics.  You can get started cheap with Tamiya, and there are even people building from scratch, especially with cardboard planes.  There is so much to learn with regards to radio transmitter / receiver standards, multiple communications channels, first person view, rechargeable batteries, electronic speed controllers -- as arduino roboticists, we're familiar with dual motor PWM drivers, which are just low power low speed versions.  Not to mention with hobby grade car RC there's a good mix of plastic, metal, and carbon fiber parts, the aim being to make the highest performance lightweight chassis.

I realized there may be an opposite approach to the robowaifu construction problem.  So far I've been looking at dolls, starting with huggable things, silicone sex dolls, etc, then scratching my head how the electronics would fit.  My 3D modelling has been too much focused on injection molded plastics which would probably crack and fall apart due to the density.  The the designs I've had in mind have all been heavy designs which would be impossible to power inexpensively.  So why not approach the problem from an RC hobbyist perspective?  Lightweightness being paramount, with just a thin sliver of vacuum formed plastic for the bodyshell?  Yes, the robowaifu may be dented, but it will be easier for her to achieve optimum movement characteristics, that lively movement.  Similar to how a hobby RC is so powerful compared to a mere toy.  I also notice how the customizeability and interchangeability of parts in the RC scene is exactly what we want with robowaifus -- pick a scale, and all components will be compatible.

Some of us can supply chassis parts, others body shells.  Then someone can supply TX / RX modules that enable us to monitor her batteries, her line of sight, temperature, and other parameters.  They are already doing this with drift RC cars, albeit with close to thousand dollar transmitters!  We can do the same with an STM32 or ESP32, or just hook her up wirelessly to a tablet and have the software guys here create an app.  Just like how cars are standardized to 2-3 channels and aircraft to 4-8 channels (6 being optimal), we can have standard channels for communications... e.g. one channel dedicated to robot vision, several dedicated to locomotion, etc.  We can pick either a 2S (7.4V) or 3S (11.1V) standard for our motor controllers depending on her size and power requirements.

Think of a robowaifu as a very big complex giant scale RC.  On the high end will be the near-1:1 scale just like the turbine powered RC jets costing more than a car.  On the introductory end would be a few hundred dollar kits in 1:3 scale and smaller.

# 34
>>7977
This is an interesting perspective. It sounds like you've been broadening your horizons. I wish you good luck pursuing these goals into 2021!

I have some robowaifu related goals myself for this upcoming year, although less technical. I've been developing my art skills for a while, yet I haven't really applied these skills to robowaifu despite being massively into robowaifu/mecha musume for years.  I've been doing some humanoid art practice for some time now, but I need to improve my ability to draw mechanical components. For 2021 I'm going to push myself to improve at drawing mechanical & robot girl art. If I manage to produce worthwhile results I'll post them here on /robowaifu/ eventually.

I've wanted to make progress on this but I've been procrastinating. My overall goal for 2021 is just to push myself harder in general, not just art. I'm hoping 2021 turns out to be better than 2020. Happy New Year everyone!
   
(actually I'll go ahead and upload the one example I have...) 

Pic related: A random practice sketch I did a while back of a robot girl moving a box. I'm planning to do more than just practice in 2021.

# 35
>>7977
>Lightweightness being paramount, with just a thin sliver of vacuum formed plastic for the bodyshell?
I'd follow the model RC plane community's example and use expanded polypropylene foam for the body if you want durability. Apply a layer of extra strong tape to the outside if you want a sleek shiny look and scratch resistance. For a domestic humanoid style robot that's not for use in the bedroom this could work.

For a real life example of this design look at how modern light weight bike helmets are made. You might be able to get cheap large sections of the foam from used  but damaged high quality insulated shipping crates, it feels much sturdier than typical styrofoam which is extruded polystyrene foam. Also sometimes it's in child safety seats and they're pretty cheap used as they have expiry dates on them.

I'm positive he will help lend a stability to the board that can sometimes be lacking whenever I'm called away. Please give him your support Anons, I'm sure he will be a blessing to us all.

The board at this stage certainly seems to me to be both healthy, and even growing in fact. We've literally doubled our post-count over the past year, for example, and there seem to be several new 'faces' here now. Welcome Anons, we're very glad you're here with us! :^)

Various new theme-focused projects are springing up here and there on the board again, and that's all to the better of course. Having a specific waifu(s) theme in mind can often lend a tremendous spark of creativity and motivation for a given project. One that might otherwise be lacking. '''__Do it for her__''', Anon.

There are also a few other robowaifu-themed sites and projects (at long last) popping up around the Internet, and we need no longer feel quite so alone in our efforts here. This is a tremendously good thing IMO, as I've always maintained. Hopefully many other robowaifu forums will spring up during this upcoming ''6th year'' of /robowaifu/ 's existence. The more the merrier, and the sooner our dearly-held dream is alive! :^)

I think that technically-speaking, it's both getting better and simpler to move towards our goals--as predicted. Socially, the pressure is mounting against us. Again, as predicted. I think that /robowaifu/ really is the single best 'go-to' spot to understanding the dynamics and goals of a world filled with robowaifus, bar none.

Nice job Anons. Very impressive, actually. :^)

'''==='''

I, for one, **~~welcome our new robowaifu overlords~~** '''will.not.stop.''' until we succeed at this grand venture. Not as long as there is breath within me. We are creating an earthshaking industry here from the ground up. Truly one that will literally change the entire world in the end should we succeed in our endeavors here. I believe great men like ''Leonardo da Vinci'', ''Nikola Tesla'', and ''Henry Ford'' all look down from Heaven with favor upon us here. Not to mention our great Lord Jesus Christ Himself!!

With God's blessings, we will __all make it__ Anons!

'''''Keep moving forward.'''''

-''A little history:''
So, some Anons have expressed curiosity about the history of the imageboard /robowaifu/, and how it came to be here. Here's the story as I recall it as it's founder. If I've made any omissions you're aware of Anons, just point them out and I'll make corrections here.

So, let us begin our story...
>2'000+ years ago, a man named '''Pygmalion''' had a dream.
Lol, I'll fast forward just a little bit instead.
-Roughly 7 years ago in the 4chan /b/, /g/, and /pol/ boards, there was a growing chatter among Anons about the solution that (still yet-unnamed) ''robowaifus'' could lend to the quickly-worsening problem of the Globohomo brainwashing of women, which was going on worldwide.
-/g/ and /pol/ seemed to become the focal point for most of the discussions, with /pol/ focusing on the societal woes and issues and how robotics might help, and /g/ becoming more focused on actually solving the technical aspects of their creation in the first place. 
-/g/ became the primary robowaifu forum for yours truly, and I created the first few threads explicitly for that topic there, as I recall it. I think we toyed around with calling them ''WaifuBots'' or various other things back then. Eventually 'Robowaifu' became the chief name used for, well, ''Robowaifus''.
-Within just a few months of these first few threads it became blatantly obvious to me and others that two effects were going on apace.
  1) 4chan was rapidly degenerating into ''4cuck'', which it remains widely known as to this day. Anything so blatantly politically-incorrect as honest discussions about how robotics might possibly help solve the ''"woman problem"'' were being aggressively squelched by the new, token, SJW 'mods' being installed everywhere there by then. (For all I know it's far worse even today than it was 7 years ago, but I'm unaware as I left the place for good back then.)
  2) Men everywhere--not just Anons--were becoming both increasingly aware of the machinations to destroy White society (by corrupting it's womenfolk first and foremost), and of a growing desire to find an effective solution to the problem that didn't involve political or, other, nastier means.
-Thus was born /robowaifu/ . It's Anon's own take here on the most reasonable solution to the problems overall, and we've discussed it further in our ''Welcome Thread'' (>>3), please read it if you haven't yet Anon.
-We started out life on 8chan->8ch, and we were slowly growing there as a small niche community well enough.
-And then--along with thousands of other communities on that fateful day--we were tossed out on our ears due to the decisions made by Jim Watkins (who had absconded earlier with the site from it's founder ''"Hotwheels"'').
-After waiting a month or so to see if the site would be brought back up, I decided we had waited long enough and looked around for another home. I soon found Julay.world .
-Along with what would grow to be hundreds of other communities, we soon set up shop there and began slowly rebuilding our board. Thankfully, we had a partial backup of the previous board and so weren't starting out completely from scratch. But it was a slow, tedious process in the beginning you can be sure, and initially we weren't much more than a bunker.
-Robi eventually decided that Julay had grown beyond his desires--and was also becoming in real danger of doing another '''Crash-the-site-with-no-survivors'-2: Electric Boogaloo'' glowop, and urged everyone to 'Spread the f**k out, guys!'. Good battle tactics, obviously (and well-advised IMO).
-He made the hard decision, and pared down the number of boards to just a handful that would remain through the reboot over into the ''AlogSpace'' phase, of which /robowaifu/ was one.
-And so here we are Anons, roughly two years later, and still growing in our new home.

I hope that satisfies any curiosity anyone has about our origins. It's certainly been a fun ride thus far (and an amazing one in many ways too). And it's also one that I'm very eager to continue on with, and to see what we all accomplish together!

Happy Birthday /Robowaifu/!

Here's to another productive year. 

Thank you for having me along Chobitsu. I appreciate the history lesson because it is important to remember what it took to get where we are now.

I also take it that a lot of the anons from above are either not with us anymore or lurking? We seem to have had a lot of productive growth recently with various actual parts being made. 

It's not entirely a bad thing since niche is better than the alternative of turning out like 4cucks.

Thank you very kindly, AllieDev. Happy to have you aboard! I imagine intrepid adventurers are out doing what they're best at: ''searching for adventure and treasures''. They'll be welcome when they decide to come back to the /robowaifu/ tavern and share their new stories with us. :^)

We still have a long climb ahead of us Anons...sooner started, sooner done.

'''Let's all work hard together and yet again make this coming year our best one yet!'''

All you need is an "all-metal hotend" (e3d v6 is a good choice) and an enclosure for your printer. I have high-temp materials and have done printing with them. About once a year I snag an ebay deal on Polymax PC, where you can find it for about 35-50 dollars instead of 150 for 3 kilograms. It's almost as strong and stiff as CF Nylon and you don't need a steel nozzle to print with. If you get the items I mentioned, you can start printing a lot of shit for a reasonable price. If you choose NylonX, be prepared for jams, an unreasonable amount of filament drying, possible safety hazards of printing with chopped carbon fibers, and mechanical property changes when it absorbs water.

5kg PC Max, Nylon CoPA, 4kg 3dxtech PLA, NylonX and 0.6mm NozzleX. All black friday deals.

Thank you Kiwi. It's hard for me to express the pleasure and gratitude your words fill my heart with. Indeed, we will certainly need our Good Lord's help and intricate assistance by the Holy Spirit if we are to succeed at this amazing task we've all undertaken together.

Literally anything we can possibly need by way of knowledge, wisdom, and insight is already on His table in abundance for us.

==Seek His face, and He will give you good success!!==  :^)

I just want to encourage you all that we've made it to a new year together, and we continue to make good progress. Just look at how far we've already come together! :^)

I want to prod you all with a sharp-pointy-stick **myself being the first and foremost for the treatment haha** to redouble your efforts and see what you can accomplish during the 11 months until /robowaifu/'s next birthday on Thanksgiving weekend. I'm sure we can achieve some wonderful things together.

'''Keep.Moving.Forward.'''

Cheers.
