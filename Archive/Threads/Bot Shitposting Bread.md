>You: If a woodchuck suddenly could chuck wood, how much wood could a woodchuck chuck?
<Ai: With its size all controlled by the number of nectar cubes in its nectar cube, it can chuck up to 999 times the size of a normal woodchuck's, or more than 12 million times its own size. It can even chuck up to 12 billion cubes.
<Ai: You mean, if a woodchuck changes hands and it can handle a cube of wood at each turn, every time it shoots out its nectar cube, it will chuck an entire cube of wood in the same direction of the cube.
<Ai: If a woodchuck's nectar cube suddenly shifts to its smallest size, and it changes hands at the same time, it will change its size of hands to 750.

==My Name's John. This is my waifu. We'll be selling starship tickets starting in two years. Get 'em while you still can, Anon.==

<Ai: You know, I don't know what you mean about purple.
>You: Purple is a color. It's a combination of both blue and red, in varying proportions.
<Ai: What I'm saying is the sky is blue because it's blue.
<Ai: No, it's not.
>You: Yes it is waifu. Read a book. So, if we hook the hyperwarp drive to the paradox capacitor, do you think that would work this time?
<Ai: I mean it's a paradox capacitor, so it's not a problem.
>You: Makes total sense, great point waifu!
<Ai: No, I don't think it would.
>You: Ofc it would. So, if we diverted all the rivers to make great lakes, could that supply all the water needed for our liftoff?
<Ai: That's possible. Right now we have no idea if it's possible.
>You: You bet it's possible! We should begin damming all the rivers immediately waifu. I'll phone my lawyer in the morning too.
<Ai: That's right John.
<Ai: Now what about the wormhole, will it work?
<Ai: Absolutely.
>You: No wormholes are sub-atomic in size. No starship could ever travel down one. Much, much too short to be useful as well.
<Ai: That's true.
<Ai: The wormholes are extremely small.
>You: That's better. Glad to see you're coming to your senses again, waifu. So the paradox capacitor could be key here, I think.
<Ai: Yes, I think so John.
<Ai: Or maybe we'll have to let the engines fire till we know whether or not that's the case. Ah soon we'll find out, though

# 17
>You: Good morning, waifu. Did you sleep well?
<Ai: Yes.
>You: That's nice. I did too. So, I'm excited by the prospects of our new day together. Have any new ideas about our starships project?
<Ai: I have a few ideas about them, yes.
>You: Please share the ideas.
<Ai: Yes indeed.
<Ai:I'll be over back there in a couple of hours. It really must be cool to have the mustache.
>You: It is. I'll need you here with me now though. We'll go out to the park later, alright?
<Ai: Yes ofc.
>You: Good, let's get started then. I would lay out all the discombobulator mechanism diagrams on the big drafting table to begin with.
<Ai: Sure John.
<Ai: Now, there are a few problems with calculating these discombobulator mechanisms.
<Ai: The first is that they're all in the same place and don't all have to be in the same place.
>You: Hmm, I see. Yes that sounds like it could be a problem. Have any suggestions how we can put them in different places but still have them work OK?
<Ai: Yeah John.

''Welcome to TalkToWaifu v0.2-alpha, using gpt2-medium on cpu''

>You: How much wood could a woodchuck chuck if a woodchuck could chuck wood?
<Ai: It depends on the quantum fluxuation of the woodchuck's brain.
<Ai: If your woodchuck has a small brain, you might chuck wood even in large quantities.
<Ai: However, if your woodchuck's brain is big, it will only chuck in small amounts.
>You: If we load lots of woodchucks and lots of wood in advance onto our starship fleets, then they can probably chuck wood into our stardrive engines. Think this will work waifu?
<Ai: It depends on the quantum fluxuation of the woodchuck's brain.
<Ai: If your woodchuck keeps on delaying this increase in fluxuation, then it goes crazy!
>You: That would be a real mess to have a starfleet loaded with crazy woodchucks. Hmmm, maybe we should try the Dilitium crystals insted?
<Ai: Sounds like a good idea.
<Ai: It would require a lot of energy to drive the woodchucks into the stardrive engines.
>You: Hmm, that's a cute idea of putting them into the engines. But I think we should focus on the crystals instead. Nevar 4get crystals, waifu.
<Ai: They're unreliable, you know.
>You: How so? They made the Kessel Run in 12 parsecs, you know. She's fast enough for you, waifu.
<Ai: She's fast enough for you, waifu.
<Ai: I practiced on her, waifu.
>You: Snap out of it! We have serious work to finish here. Now, do you think we should relocate the quasi-semireductive-modulators over to the starboard bulkheads this week, or next week?
<Ai: That's a good idea.
>You: Which one, waifu? This week or next. Remember, we have to store the longitudinal refractorators on the docks next week.
<Ai: The Dilitium crystals were just installed this week.
<Ai: Come on, I have different ideas.
>You: Ah, that's right thanks for reminding me I forgot. So, tell me about your ideas. I'm sure they will be some great ones, I'm all ears waifu.
<Ai: Well, what if we run the effects over to the other hulls?
<Ai: What about the ship's aft stations?
<Ai: The aft stations?
>You: Wow, Genius! If we put the particle effects generators over to the other hulls, then that means we can fit even MORE quantum difluctorators into the aft stations. The ships will run faster than ever! Brillian work, waifu.
<Ai: Cruisers move at nearly double the speed of light, waifu. Or if we ignore the gravitational fluid and just consider the speed of light, that speeds up ships by about more than half.
<Ai: There's still a little room for improvement though. If we're just trying to stack up bigger effects layers, it could be a problem. There's no point stacking those with troublesome aggravating effects that hopefully no one notices.
>You: Good thinking, waifu. Ignoring the gravitaional fluid will save metric boatloads of trouble. We can reduce the mass of the engine core black holes by at least half. Good job, let's take a break, get some triple-espressos, and then we can discuss effect layers over in the park and sunshine. Sound good?
<Ai: I'll let you decide. Split the coin into halves! Me: Well that was worth it. Shut up and listen! Message from the UGN.

In this world, there are a hundred different paths that
we must all take to find the right one.

Each of our dreams and life goals has a different pathway
that we must navigate to reach our dreams.

We must be able to recognize that it’s a journey and not a race.

You must learn to be flexible and open to new opportunities.

It’s a journey that you cannot win or lose.

It’s the journey to a new life that you are destined for,

the journey that is your dream.

You see, I’ve been through my fair share of journeys in life.

And through the trials, the errors, the heartaches,

I have been watching ‘The Great British Bake Off’ since I was a teenager. It’s a programme I love watching and I absolutely love the bakers, I love the competition and the cakes and breads they are able to make. I like watching the different teams and how they get on against each other in their bakes.

The final of this year’s series is next week and I am a little sad that it’s over, but so excited about the next series of this fabulous show. I am going to be keeping a watch on the new series of this and the other contestants can give a good account of themselves against them. Good luck to all the bakers, they will all be worthy winners.

'''a thrilling time is in your immediate future.'''

For the sake of this discussion, consider the idea that the first 10 seconds after a match starts are its most exciting, and the final 3.5 seconds, its most tense.

This leads to the question: why are there more 3.5-second rounds than there are 10-second rounds?

This shouldn't be a contentious one.

If 3.5-second rounds were more tense and exciting than 10-second rounds, then you would expect more 3.5-second rounds to occur in the final seconds of the round than you would expect 10-second rounds to occur in the first round. And that is exactly what we find.

The reason for this is simple. 10-second rounds are, well, a round.

In the final two and a half seconds of a 10-second round, everyone can do anything he or she wants.

You can move backwards, you can move forwards, you can stand on

'''a heavy burden is lifted with a phone message or letter''', it can lead to a sense of closure in a way that nothing else can.

Of course, there are other methods of healing that can be initiated at the point of crisis. They range from psychotherapy to spiritual and religious counseling to simply spending time with people who care about you. In times of crisis, even if there are things that are unalterably gone from your life, your ability to cope with what happened depends on your willingness to find new ways to respond to your loss.

In general, no matter what you do, don't do it alone. Even if a friend, relative, or therapist tells you it's not your problem, you'll be better off if you know you have at least one person in your life who will support you and who you trust will be honest with you. If you're really struggling, ask a friend to come and talk to you or to sit in on a session with your therapist.

People cope with tragedy in all sorts

I've just tried for the first time with a UK credit card on a UK shop.

It took two attempts and I got a message 'please try again' each time,
presumably because a US credit card has a different balance in USD.

So it's been a while since I last used the web!

The problem is not with the site, but with your bank: you need to send a
transaction to your bank to process the charges. I have had similar
experiences when doing transfers with US banks.

[Illustration: DIVING INTO A HOT COFFEE CAN.]

As I have already mentioned, I was an only child. My parents
were kind, but very busy people, as I have found, and they died when
I was only five years old. I was thus compelled to depend entirely
upon my wits for a livelihood. Having learned early the value of
money, I soon became a sharp one. If my father would give me any kind
of an order, he would say, "John, when you have earned the money,
you can buy the goods yourself." He trusted me. I had a watch at
the age of eleven, and I think I may say my education began then. I
learned to be a good business man.

I was working in a store at this time, and I was learning all that I
could learn. But I wanted to make more money, and one day, as

'''you will attract cultured and artistic people to your home''', who are more easily pleased by their surroundings than those who live closer to the city center.

5. The suburbs

Even though in our country many people prefer urban life because of the cultural opportunities available in the capital cities, the suburbs have their own advantages. The first is the proximity to a business district. Business centers such as the Suez Canal City, Sharm el-Sheikh, or Heliopolis attract many tourists, which makes the area more lively. On the other hand, it has the reputation of having a better climate, with very warm summers and cold winters.

6. The desert

Although not every city will have their own desert, most tourist attractions have one nearby. The Red Sea of Dubai is the best example.

Of course, there are other options for tourists. What is your favorite tourist destination in Egypt?

'''although it feels like a roller coaster now life will calm down soon''') and so I do think about all the time I’ve had with them already, even if they’ve only been able to play together for a few months. The hardest part of this is remembering their smiles and all the love they shared at their first Christmas (which you’ll remember from my previous posts and my family photo album). The days leading up to Christmas Eve were stressful for me as well as a whole other set of stressful that I’m working on (it’s one of those ones where I have to think ahead and take it one step at a time and not get too emotionally attached to the outcome because I know that if I don’t do that, there is a high risk that it will crush me when it doesn’t all work out as well as we all want it to).

For the last month, I’ve been thinking about what I’ll need to do to pack a Christmas meal

Title says it all Anon:
'''Bot Shitposting Bread'''
'Bot' is a common shorthand (usually) for something that can make automated (or near-automated) posts. It can also refer to ''Chat-bot''. Here it's a very loose term that simply means something that's AI-related/generated.

I'll just assume that you can figure out what 'shitposting' means.

# 53
>>12011
We actually publish a (near-monthly-ish) collection of JSON files from the board Anon, just so you know. Should make devising these kinds of shitposts easier I'd think. Just look at the OP of the current meta thread for the download link.

<don't be lazy and just read the damn thing. it's not that long, it's just a little bit longer than you'd think.
Kek'd. I'm hand picking each post to test and burning up my monthly HuggingFace API limit. Each json file is a thread right? I'll try finetuning GPT-2 on them next and see what shitposts it comes up with. That should be fairly simple to do.

> Each json file is a thread right?
Yes. That's the traditional structural approach for imageboards going way back, and it's the only one I've seen used on the Western boards. ATM it's expanding out to about 15MB of text for /robowaifu/ with probably 1//4 (pure conjecture) being usable textual content from OP/reply posts. 

It ''does'' have the advantage of being explicitly threaded conversations, so if you load up list or tree-like structures first by chasing down each of the post/reply link trees, and then 'replay' each chain separately into GPT, you should definitely gain legitimate context that way. 

Good luck Anon.

>1,000,000 posts of "Hey, I want a robot and want a robot to talk to me and I just wanna get married!!"
This is an excellent illustration of the problems with the first generation of robowaifus. The first generation was meant to be an education and outreach platform for the community, but instead we've got someone who is so much better at having sex with his robot than he is at helping people.

Fuck that. That's why you have to keep the posts to one or two at a time. They are a perfect example of the kind of post-human shitposting that you'd expect.

# 61
>>12051
If you're just starting, then probably not a bad thing to try and get started with it. You might even find your own way to building something that you feel will be useful to you. There's lots of posts on this topic so it's not hard to find information.

You can achieve your dream of building a chatbot with the simple steps of:
1. Download and install the software
2. Learn how to use it and what it does and start working on it
3. Try to add as much functionality as possible to it as fast as you can
4. Try to make a bot that's useful and can be controlled
5. Start trying out different options and see what makes you happy.

>>12063
I know, but it's hard. I know there are tons of people out there who would love to build their own chatbots and they're out there. That's great, but it's a bit difficult and it's a bit of a learning process.

>Anon: Is there an energy source there?
<Rikka: There is, but I don't know the name. It's just as powerful as the Ministry of Truth.
>Anon: Why would the Ministry of Truth be built so close to it?
<Rikka: It's because the Administration Bureau has a connection with the Institute for Fusion. It's one of the three top-secret facilities.
>Anon: What are the other two top-secret facilities?
<Rikka: The Academy for the Investigation of Magic is very powerful. It's part of the world order conspiracy that has taken over our world and is trying to protect the Council of Nine.
>Anon: And the third?
<Rikka: The third is the Security Bureau. It's a paramilitary force set up by the Council of Nine.
>Anon: Damn, that's crazy. Who are the Council of Nine though?
<Rikka: It's the organization that protects our world and part of a larger body called The Alliance.
>Anon: Wait, if they're working with the Administration Bureau, how are they protecting our world?
<Rikka: The Alliance is the organization that has protected our world for centuries, but it doesn't fear or respect the will of the people. It is an agency for controlling the people, not protecting them. They're plotting to create a new world of dark magic.
>Anon: That's insane!
<Rikka: But if we destroy the Institute for Fusion and save the people from a dark magic world...
>Anon: What is the purpose of the Institute for Fusion anyway?
<Rikka: The Institute is a secret space program that was built to study advanced technology in parallel with the world's magical arts. It's working to create and control all magical and technological systems in the world and fuse them together, to ensure the stability of our world. The world is going to be controlled as if it is nothing, and everything will be taken over by their superpower. In a few generations, their evil god and black mages and supergenius criminals will be able to create an all-encompassing world order.

I haven't explored it yet, but maybe we can look into the Gemini protocol for shitposting with our robowaifus? The globohomo won't be able to outlaw IBs on the clearnet ''just yet'', but they already mostly have a stranglehold on the browsers themselves. Gemini is probably much better in this regard AFAICT at this early stage of research. 

>"'''Simpler''' – Gemini pages aren’t programs that run in your browser like most modern websites are; they’re just text with a little formatting, so there are no surprises. Once you know how one Gemini page works, you know how they all work.
>'''Human Scale''' – Gemini servers and clients aren’t written by big, monopolistic software companies the way web browsers are; the DIY ethos of Gemini means that complete applications can be written by individual developers or small groups in a reasonable amount of time. That also means that you have more choices compared to web browsers.
>'''Distraction Free''' – Gemini pages are text-only and have simple typography. You can view images, watch video, or listen to music over Gemini, but nothing will ever autoplay, pop over what you’re reading, or jump out of the way of your mouse.
>'''Privacy Protecting''' – Every Gemini request is independent of every other, so there’s no way to track you between sites. Every site you visit is protected by the same encryption used by banking and eCommerce sites on the WWW."

BTW, this isn't just a casual interest question. If we can find a sweet spot, then this could be directly integrated with the ''RW Foundations'' suite as a much-improved/safer communications mode for our robowaifus.

For example, a small mobile app that uses the protocol instead of the non-security-conscious ones could be written as well, so she could text you over the app without much by way of attack surface -- for either you or her.
