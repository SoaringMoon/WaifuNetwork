I'm basically trying to compile a lot of videos and files relating to many different humanoid robotics projects so I have a basis of where to start. I have a 3D printer but am currently unsure on materials, thus why I'm looking for inspiration.

That's definitely truth. Someone once said "None of us is as smart as all of us."
In some way, we are kind of like the earliest hackers of personal computers. Search 'Homebrew Computer Club'. This is literally frontier work here. In 20 years robowaifus will be commonplace but definitely aren't right now. It's kind of like lots of anons around the world are all working towards this goal and we all get to define an entire new industry from the ground up. Pretty neat actually.

==Awesome Eye Mechanism and Application into a Head.==

This is the design I plan to use for my head's eyes. Once I'm on holiday in a month or so I should have the time to learn Blender and 3D print the frame whilst working on other projects.

If I build something good, I'll upload the files and post a tutorial for other anons. I'm thinking of combining this with the OLED eye system to get something awesome.

# 30

It looks like he used the same two servos to move the eyes, but two separate servos to move the eyelids. So this robot could wink but not cross its eyes.

# 31
>>3438
Exactly! Also, the eye movement is a lot more natural because of how the wires are attached to the eyes. So unless someone's fetish is being cross-eyed this rig will give us a very high quality outcome with minimal complexity.
Mind you, for the sake of ahegao I may be… forced to remove the cross support so both eyes can move independent of each other.

It's a good design, especially using shrink-wrap in place of springs and wires. The only problem I see with it is how it bends when working, so a metal or stronger plastic alternative would be needed for the base.

On the topic of DS Doll, it appears that they're using hydraulics for the arms. Might be something for us to look into.

# 42
>>3449
Interesting tbh. As I see it, the primary issue with hydraulics is that many of these oils are at least partly toxic to a degree, and the maintenance and management of fluids in a mobile system are dubious at best tbh. Still, it does afford the possibility of (super)human-tier strength levels in a mobile platform using current technology. Which, if I'm not mistaken, is one of the established goals in the Welcome to /Robowaifu/ bread. So yea.

# 47
>>3451
Hydraulics can be made in a completely sealed system without worrying about the oils. Yes, you could in theory build a super strong waifu, she'd just be power hungry. You only start to save money compared to gear motors at very high strengths. It seems like an interesting and exciting prospect but, it's very expensive and finicky. Also, tends to have jerky movements. Fantastic for heavy industry where something stronger then pneumatics is needed and the increase in cost is warranted. For waifus, yes, you can make her with very slim cylinders but, you're honestly better off using your motors that would drive the hydraulics to just drive cabling. Cables transfer torque more efficiently anyways. I haven't the slightest idea of why they would use hydraulics. Then again I've only used hydraulics industrially, maybe they're found some way to mitigate its inefficiency? Using a regulated internal engine would give them good run times at the expense of increased complexity, need for regular check ups, and she'd need to drink gas. She'd also small like an engine. Overall, unless you're very rich with access to your own manufacturing equipment, hydraulics isn't the best idea. Pneumatics would be better if you're going to try to lower costs. Though, gear motors are honestly the best.
(I have built, troubleshooted, and repaired hydraulic/pneumatic systems. Hydraulics were a pain in my ass, so I'm a tad biased against them. Loved working with pneumatics though.)

# 48

Genius. Kiwi, you may very well have found the sweet spot of strength/price/performance.

# 49

They have a website and YouTube account but they have a lot fewer videos on them. So Twatter is our best bet if we wanna stalk their progress.

It's a recent change they've made. I assume they're either saving money with hydraulics, wanted a sleeker looking demo model, or ran into a problem with cables and gears.

Nice skeletal design but I think most of those plastic parts are aesthetic.  Seems they were going for cyberpunk.

On the other hand, would be great to have a more steampunk internal skeleton, I would definitely love my waifu to look like a clockwork doll when you open her up, especially if she were wearing a maid outfit.  I think I'll just need to use brown/silver/gold colored plastics and go Rococo even if it's really just a waste of material.

It would seem that companies (and Robowaifu Technicians) in general are too focused on the face. Most the projects I find focus a lot on it despite it not being that important. Why hasn't a single builder gotten us a robo-waifu that can snuggle with us? Probably because faces take a lot of time and money.

TBH, we're all hardwired literally from birth to be tightly focused on the faces of those around us, so it's a natural and honest drive. However, as our fascination with cute anime waifus shows, you can definitely manage an affection towards a female character whose face is plainly not fully human. I'd say this is a common theme here on /robowaifu/ now. The 'cute waifus, not slutbots' approach.
The Uncanny Valley is very real, and is still a long way off from being solved. And even when ** if?** it does get solved, it will be very expensive for the first generation or two to recoup R&D costs.

# 88

Speaking of robo-cuties. I've been considering the idea of using soft-robots alongside my 3D printer to build a basic waifu that can crudely snuggle with you. Unfortunately, I'd have to prototype at a adult scale for legality's sake (more expensive), and my lack of experience. I don't even know if it's worth trying. Probably would do me more good to just release robo-waifu propaganda in the form of video games instead. Especially considering my roommates lol.

# 89

>that can crudely snuggle with you
We have at least one daki bread and the notion is fairly popular here and elsewhere. Maybe something like that? I don't know what to tell you about your roommates haha, I'm in the same boat. Eventually I think I'm just not going to worry about what others think about it. The obvious failure of Western women to their societies has made the robowaifu-pill an obvious choice for millions of men tbh. It seems inevitable atp.

Anyways, I think those electric muscles are a long way off. Although they'll be selling kits in Q2 2019 which might be interesting if we can replicate them or buy them on the cheap.
https://www.artimusrobotics.com/product

I'm more so considering air-muscles at this point. It looks relatively simple in concept. I didn't know air pumps could be so quiet so the prototypes can just have the majority of the tubes outside the body. Once we have a basic working humanoid (sit, cuddle, fidget, maybe move arms). An effort can be made in hiding such technology inside the waifu; but the battery is still a problem in such a case so I dunno. 

I'd be happy with a glorified torso and head tbh if it was done well enough, then add arms for cuddling, maybe pretending to play vidya, etc. BTW, there's a tutorial on how to build this muscle system. Might be a cheaper and easier alternative than servos and whatnot.

Thanks for the heads up anon. They look like a good team, I hope they can manage a mass-producible product we could actually use as hobbyists.

Yes, I think pneumatics are a reasonable possibility, much more so than hydraulics. They are widely used in the Dark Ride animatronics industry, but they are in fact still noisy. But for the exact same reasons they work in that field, they would also work in robowaifus.

As far as just an upper body goes it would in fact be much easier to manage the development of but ofc it's not fuggable. Anon's little moebot-tier robowaifu project ]]4637 is appealing enough an idea and shows that some robowaifus can be just for huggs, not for fuggs.

Yea an anon has been saying here since the beginning we should let the characterization of our robowaifus allow for the fact they are, in fact, robots.

Someone was planning to make an IRL drossel. It was cool, but the model he used was shit. I'm planning to have a project where one guy edits the model to accommodate servos and shit, one guy 3d prints/CNCs the parts (aluminum and silicone will be very important), one guy attaches the electronics, and one guy installs the AI. 

We will obviously need better models, and since the only models easily downloadable are Charming models (which while cute, will be fucking impossible because of her lack of feet). **We may have to employ the unholy wizard known as ADR, because while he is a dickgirl loving nigger, he has good models that can be edited to accommodate electronics.**

Many of these I do find the faces to be a bit disconcerting, but what's under the skin is absolutely amazing. We can't be more than a decade away from factory produced robowaifus.

# 119
I really like the LED eyes in >>3419 so that gets me thinking, until we get it to the point where the facial movements and materials are conducive to really kissing your waifu would it be easier to use a contoured display for a face? That would allow for full accurate representation of your 2D waifu as depicted in media as well as simplifying and reducing the cost of one of the most complicated and expensive portions of the robot.

>>3537
Yeah, that's what I was thinking or we just go higher on the >>>/clang/ scale until technology catches up.

those animatronics look familiar, if I recall the arms, torso, and head are all maneuvered by cables. This may just be a puppet with cleverly hidden strings. If it is self actuated though then this is an even more impressive design.

# 124
>>3541
I'm scratching my head trying to figure out why the servo hum is barely audible, at that size it's supposed to be all you can hear.

I was going to post another find, vid related, stop motion convinces me that the articulation in a typical anime action figure is enough, just need a way to swap out face plates and hand positions on the fly.

I remember when this guy built a life-size singing Hatsune Miku using what looked like some kind of high-density styrofoam attached to servos and steel hinges. Good to see he has adopted 3D printing now as well. Inspirational stuff!

# 142
>>5371
Just a guess, but the pink material looks a lot like some kind of foam, or near-enough. Still, if it's that same guy glad to see he's still at it. He became a minor sensation and made some spending money taking his Miku-chan robowaifu around and just showing her off IIRC.

# 143

Immervision is talking about a humanoid robot, named Joyce, coming out of the computer vision community. I understood one part of the article so that she would soon be available as a set to be build. However, haven't seen anything about it yet. On the site I only found the claim: "Soon, JOYCE’s programming interface will made available to the computer vision community to run experiments and upgrade her capabilities." I understand it so, that they want to show her the first time on some summit soon (might be cancelled bc Covid). Maybe the parts are freely available, and how to rebuild her will be explained after release. Otherwise it's just one more Sophia (Hanson Robotics).

I also wonder how she's going to look like: "Joyce comes equipped with three ultra-wide-angle panomorph cameras calibrated to give 2D hemispheric, 3D stereoscopic hemispheric, or full 360 x 360 spherical capture and viewing of the environment."

There have been 1/3 scale silicone animedolls before, as well as near-full-scale 90cm-100cm "stylized" sexdolls, as well as hard as rock fullscale waifu statues.  IMHO this is actually the first time I've seen a fullscale silicone waifudoll.

Amazing.

# 154

>>7709
Thanks guys, wonderful stuff. Quite inspiring progress from him.

# 155
>>7712
He seem to have started the way I planned to do it, and so far didn't make it, with some differences. Using tubes and small ball joints is a great idea for the first model (pic 26), but knees and elbows in the human body aren't ball joints but hinges. That's something I would probably honor right from the start. The shoulder area is fascinating, and something to keep in mind, though. He seem to have moved away in his later designs. Also, some of his arm designs (pic 17&19) are freaking great. With these two bones to make them twist similar to real ones and also making the bones feel like real that way. Of course, one would need to find a way to move them with motors and/or muscles.

# 156
>>7719
oh, didn't look at the knees well enough before. They are actually way better than some simple ball joints.

# 160
>>7719
>Of course, one would need to find a way to move them with motors and/or muscles.
What I've been thinking is that you could have thin metal cables snaked along the armature, maybe strategically fastened by guides at the joints, that could pull/pull the bones around from an internal centrally-located actuator arrays. Not only would this kind of mimic the actual human tendons, etc, but would also centralize much of the mass around the center of gravity in the robowaifu.

# 161
>>8604
It's good to have ideas and sharing them, but I'm quite sure actual muscles contract themselves. Airmuscles and maybe dielectric elastomers are more similar to them than tendons. I'll try to go with small motors in some bones, and then additional soft muscles. Not saying, your idea won't work, but winding tendons up and down might be slow and inflexible, for example.

# 162
>>8606
Anon just posted a video showing more or less my exact ideas, but scaled down to the hand & with the actuators out on the forearm. 
>>8632
My design notions have, as I mentioned, the actuators tucked away inside the torso. But otherwise this is an excellent example of the basic physics of the system.

# 163
Turns out, it's worth looking into who Segawa (Kibo-chan) is following on Twitter. His friends are doing similar amazing things, which are even more on topic.

Yes, this belongs to "wheelchair waifu" thread, but should be named differently. There's also the problem that visual waifu thread now includes VR, so some thread for virtual ones would be necessary as well.

Yeah, it's pretty awesome Anon. But, hey it's always good to have something for us to strive for Anon, right? Part of our general agenda is to find ways to make robowaifu construction much cheaper.

BTW, please post any more pics you obtain of this anon's project, Anon. As you say, it's an inspiration to us all.

# 205
>>10116
The creator says the small, powerful servos she needs to walk are too expensive. I looked up the cost and they're only $2500 each. :^)

# 206
>>10119

I wonder if those could be replaced with brushless motors with cycloidal gearboxes, with something like an Odrive you can get servo or stepper motor like accuracy out of them. Materials for the gearboxes would be the biggest problem, the designs I've seen for 3D-printable ones tend to be somewhat large, but could be hidden in the design.

# 207
>>10119
>"We'll never get the budget we need! It's an outrageous amount!"
Lol, I literally just finished watching the first episode of ''Robot Notes'' if you know what I'm saying.

That's obviously too expensive. But OTOH, he's probably using the wrong basic internal design. You can't have a bunch of heavy servos and other components as ''thrown weight'' out on the levers of the the extremities of arms and legs if you want to keep the costs down. These item have to be moved __inboard__ into the torso of the robowaifu, it's the only practical way.

We have Mini-Cheetah servo design from MIT (>>8415) that run about US$350/incl drivers. They have sufficient force to properly run one hip joint each, '''as long''' as other weighty components are kept inboard from their pivot attachments.

# 208
>>10121
>Robotics;Notes*
FTFM

# 209
>>10121
>They have sufficient force to properly run one hip joint each
I envision something like two of these Stewert Platforms (>>8648) situated transversally in the lower pelvis region, and serving somewhat like a ball-and-socket hip joint would behave in a typical human or other ''megafauna''. Not an actual ball-and-socket, but it would behave somewhat like it.

One Mini-Cheetah each would be affixed onto the outward-facing plate of each Stewart Platform, and provide the fore-aft motion of the upper leg. The knee & and ankles would be actuated by thin steel Bowden cables running along the leg itself. 

Micro servos can still be located distally for the basic foot/toe actuation, since they a) don't need to deliver much force to perform their own lever-actions, and b) they don't weigh much themselves.

(Oops. Actually, I'll stop here, I just realized this should actually be a post in the ''Skeletons & Armatures'' thread instead).

# 210
>>10121
>"We'll never get the budget we need! It's an outrageous amount!"
Someone building a robowaifu has managed to raise $40,000 for original voice synthesizer software. There's a lot of money to be made pioneering stuff. Just imagine how much money people will throw at someone building robowaifus to sell with a working original voice and personality.

# 211
>>10130
Yes, the pent-up demand by men everywhere is going to be a veritable tsunami of __shut up and take my money.jpg__ (>>9300). There are literally hundreds of billions of dollars to be made in the nascent robowaifu industries once they become functional, reliable, inexpensive, and appealing enough.

Highly talented and skilled ''Robowaifu Technicians'' the world over '''won't be able to hold all the things''' of people banging on their doors demanding attention regarding their wares (for good and bad heh).

For those of us who choose to capitalize on all our efforts in this way, I'd suggest the typical exit strategy of say, John McAfee. Namely, a) first build it then give it away, b) start charging a nominal fee for the millions of user to upgrade their copies, c) ???, d) Profit.

For those of you who are going to become billionaires from your robowaifu pioneering, I have but one simple request:
'''Don't become some leftist commie, Big Tech/Gov evil asshole, with all you've been given.'''

That's it.

I'd love to try and see if I could reverse engineer one, but the only photos of it's innards I could find are either low quality or don't show the entire inside. I do have an original robosapien I could work off of if the femisapien doesn't pan out

I really like the shaft-driven+u-joint actuator system for the arm that shows up well in that picture Anon. If you have any more pictures of that robot's internals please post them here. TIA.

This is the only other photo I have, it's cool to see other people interested in it's insides

# 220
>>10252
That's helpful thanks. I wonder why they discontinued her?

# 221
>>10253
Toy lines always fall out of style, it was inevitable

# 222
>>10254
I see, makes sense. BTW, apparently here's the page for her on the guy who made the video.

Thanks for bringing her up Anon.

Neat. I didn't even know about him Anon, thanks.

Wow, his original robot had a duckface for me, but her companions are much cuter in my opinion.



Time to invest in large OLED displays I guess.  I've tried plain LCDs since they were cheap but you can't see anything and the backlight is uneven.

This looks like it would hurt to look at over long periods of time.

100cm or 1m is too small after all. That onahole between her legs is really creepy at that scale. We really must be careful about height

# 228
>>14401
I like her. Better than I can do, though also not really what I want.
>>14420
She's cute and obviously a robot.

Where I live they banned all sex dolls with faces or hands or feet to even avoid the question of 'is it too cute in the face' so you're wasting your time due to the fact that normal people will be guilty of witch hunting with a very slippery slope to guide them.

Does he browse here?

# 234

Huh, a puppet on a platform is an interesting approach. Lapis Anon was on a similar track with his mini waifu long ago. Nice find Gobi. I do not see much evidence that they do browse here but, if they do, they are welcome here.

# 235
>>15542
Neat! No I'm not aware that Anon frequents /robowaifu/. But as Kiwi said, he'd be welcome here.

# 236
A good intro to omni-wheels for those who wish to use them in their waifus.

Some anons wouldn't even need to strap anything onto one. Consider a centaur or spidergirl robot base if you prefer any human features but still want a quadruped or hexapod base.

Link to the sweetiebot project? Could provide valuable information to the waifuneers here.

Kani (Japanese for crab) is where it's at!

From what I understand they want to keep things rated PG. The voice generator (community talknet project) is unrelated and based in the /ppp/ thread on 4chan.org/mlp/. Enter if you dare ^:)

>ponies

I was thinking more >>15733 or picrel, but a cute robot horse has the PR advantage because it could easily be a children's toy.

# 244
>>15731
I think some of the ponys mentioned this project to us before Anon, thanks. I wish those Russians good success!

>>15733
Heh, /monster/ pls. **:^)**
A hexapod waifu is actually a really good idea for a special-service meido 'waifu' IMO. Just my own tastes in the matter subjectively. But ''objectively'', a hexapod locomotion base (especially combined with roller 'feet' is a superior stability platform from which to do housework & other work. No question.

>>15736
Yep. I immediately came to a similar conclusion. But it's obvious they are going for police force service with the push for that bot, and the price tag shows it. Shame, tbh.

# 245
are you people serious?

all the videos are hosted offsite what the hell am I going to do with a filename put it in yandex? fucking yahoo.jp??? tor search???

why do this?

# 246
>>16233
Heh, sorry about that Anon. You're just dealing with the missing information from when our first site was destroyed on us. Those were part of the recovery effort. Unfortunately our copies of the files were lost in the attack.

Maybe someday some Anon might restore them here for us. Again apologies, you might see similar in other threads here too.

But at least we still have a board! :^)
