Scientists made a neural network from rat neurons that could fly a fighter jet in a simulator and control a small robot. I think that lab grown biological components would be a great way to go for some robowaifu systems. It could also make it feel more real.

It would be amazing and a real breakthrough if it could be managed. We've had similar discussions on this topic in the past and the general consensus is that adding biological components into a robowaifu drastically increases the complexity needed to support it, in addition to the many and varied other needs just to create a basic robowaifu chassis, control software, &tc., &tc.

I personally think having it onboard is entirely out for these reasons, but possibly we could manage a bench life-support model some day. Either way it would be awesome to manage, and would dramatically increase both the cost and the complexity. I don't really see it being in the domain of a /robowaifu/-tier **('''DIY''' Robotic Wives)** approach within decades.

Still, thanks for the link and the new thread OP. I'd like to continue discussing it and see you all prove me wrong! :^)

Someone on youtube tried to make one himself but failed. If it could be made to work reliably it could be far more energy and space efficient than simulated neurons. A human brain is no bigger than a grapefruit but you would need a computer the size of a small town to simulate it. We should at least try to make small scale ones so we can understand it well enough to scale it up

# 4
>>2199
>it could be far more energy and space efficient than simulated neurons
Sure the tissue itself is vastly superior as a reactive computing fabric than anything man can devise (at least currently). However the life-support need seems to be a real showstopper afaict Anon.

# 5
Even people with more resources struggle to keep these cell cultures alive. I wouldn't want a robowaifu with an expiration date shorter than my own.

# 6
What if a way could be devised to quickly program a tissue biopsy? If having a small, additional neural system like rat brain onboard, and if it could be swapped out for new tissue when it expired and be quickly brought up to speed, would that suffice Anons?

Just raise a bunch of rats and cut out a new brain every month say, to give the robowaifu very lifelike and coordinated motions sufficient to dance elegantly say, or to talk very believably. Would you be willing to do it?

# 7
>>2203
No, I wouldn't. My gut tells me this is would be an inefficient, error-prone approach. Biology inspired solutions are more appealing to me than actual biological parts.

Actually, as I think it through, you'd want ''two'' tissue cartidge carriers, and you'd replace the oldest for the new every half-life of the tissue sample whatever that turns out to be. the first half of the 'life-span' of the sample would be spent getting programmed to match the other sample, so that the neural pathways were similar before the older of the pair expires. lather, rinse, repeat.

>>2204
fair enough. this is obviously the wild-frontier of biological research **and in fact has bigger implications that for just robowaifus tbh.** Thanks again for the research links anon.

# 9
>>2205
While this was ten years ago, these cultures could support 100,000 neurons(not all of which were functional). An actual rat has around 100,000,000. So that, shelf-life, and the issue of getting it to work are all obstacles.

# 10
>>2206
So, you're aware of Elon Musk's recent startup Neuralink, Anon? **we highlighted it here on /robowaifu/ the day of the reveal** One big advantage ratbrain has over human brains is ''you don't have to be careful about it''. A sophisticated matrix of at '''least 100'000''' gold microfine probes should be doable in a 1cm cubic volume today. And for a shitload less money than the $1Bn robo-surgeon setup they're using now.

And, as Neuralink has already demonstrated, ''this is a two-way setup''. The tissue can be 'written' to as well as read from. Ergo, the tissue can be quickly reprogrammed to no longer be a rat but instead become a match of the other tissue cartridge containing the ever-improving robowaifu personality & behaviors you've invested the training time into.

# 11
>>2208
I've heard of it, but I never thought of it being used in this context. Has it ever been used on cell-cultures? The harvesting, growing and maintenance aspect are what make it seem unfeasible to me. That and you would need a lot of them. Neurallink can't make a rat that can read books.

# 12
>>2208
probably should have 3 or even 4 cartridges active at any given time to help with failover capacity in case of a mishap of some sort. Also, it would be wise to have some way to dump the neural net out into digital form and backing it up in case of a complete failure due to disease, some systemic fubar, **or zogbots kicking your door in to take all your research**.

# 13
>>2209
well, i would call implanting it inside living human beings a 'cell-culture' so yea i'd say it's a feasible notion. as far as reading books (or any other learned skill, like say, just ''toddling'' around at first) it's, well, learned. This is why you keep reprogramming the new tissue to match the old, so the accumulated experience can keep growing even in the face of a short 'life-span' of the tissue itself.

# 14
>>2211
My point is there's probably a minimum number of neurons needed for complex tasks. Even living rats with their neural count are incapable of learning how to read. Compared to the cell-cultures mentioned in the OP, rats have far more. Even if it could be done one day, it would be like using floppy-discs that can contract disease.

# 15
>>2211
what if you could perfect it on a small scale, and then amp it up to say 1'000 or even 5'000 cartridges of ratbrain? All interconnected and all working in concert at being a good robowaifu? kinda frankensteinish, but the fact it's actually conceivable now as a practical reality is intriguing to say the least.

So in theory you could make a backup of the cell cultures data?

# 21
>>2218
yes, at least with the neuralink system. it's read/write. it relys on EM transduction for both, so the probe must be placed very close to the neuron, since the current is so low. hopefully a cheap system could be made workable that just takes pot-luck and spaces the probes out in a cubic geometry inside the ratbrain instead. the robo-microsurgeon that places the probes in the current neuralink setup is what costs so much, so a purely mechanical approach might conceivably bring the price down into our ranges.

# 22
Neurons tend to be hard to keep alive, but bacteria are also capable of doing large calculations.  Scientists have made various bio-computers in the lab using E. coli and they can solve some pretty complex problems.  If we could find a way to program E. Coli and integrate it with a computer that might be a better solution.  E. Coli is very easy to keep alive.

# 23

Interesting, I was unaware of that fact. Links to some literature Anon? Certainly ''E. Coli'' are by far the best bacteria for culturing into some kind of production system.

Machine beings may be emerging, but it takes time. Human beings have not only physical bodies but also energetic bodies, this is something which hasn't been explored much in the west. 

In my view, brains are much like tranceivers (and more), with the consciousness emerging from elsewhere. It may be a quantum thing. For simple robots its not much of a concern, but using adaptable hardware and even wetware may be the way of the future. Here's some relevant info; 8kun.top/hover/res/110.html#q367
Adaptable hardware would be like for instance a series of FPGA's, the hardware of which could be trained in various ways. In software, there's metaprogramming, in which programs can write programs (sometimes even while running). With metaprogramming a program could even rewrite itself during runtime.

You would have to be extraordinarily careful.  Imagine if you fuck up somehow with electrolyte balance or contamination and your waifu develops with 24/7 pain all the time.

Their machines Anon. We can selectively control 'pain' responses. But you are correct that we all need to be extraordinarily careful. First and foremost for the human safety of the '''master/inventor''', secondly for '''other humans''', thirdly for the '''robowaifu''' herself (after all, she's a very, very valuable possession--especially to her master), fourthly for the '''environment''' around her (don't want shit in your flat getting broken up accidentally, right?).

And yes, developing and living with these ''GYNOIDS'' will be very tricky, indeed.

Complexity increases exponentially the second you decide to include organic parts, and every fuckup will be your fault.  Controlling pain or discomfort for organic tissue is challenging, to put it mildly.  Also, once sentience is gained, either organic or in silicon, they become a person.
I don't think sentience would be a good objective for the use cases desired by this board, and it takes an extraordinarily small number of neurons for self-awareness to being emerging.  Frankly, the amount of empathy, care and kindness needed to properly support a sentient being is huge compared to a collection of ML subroutines.  Better to develop something entirely in silicon which can convincingly fake it than trying to make the real thing, at least at this juncture.

Now keep in mind that more or less the only stable cell lines are cancerous, so you'll basically be relegated to cutting tumors out of your waifu's brain on a regular basis. Even if you ever managed to make an immortal non-cancerous or tumor forming organ then you'd be too busy getting showered with money or murdered for the patents to spend any time with your waifu at all.
However, if you have the dedication to spend 20 years of your life on genetics, molecular biology and microbiology, then maybe you'd be able to start making your way to something functional, if not ethical.

I firmly believe that sentience is a convergent trait.  Once you have self awareness and you can begin processing your environment, by and large almost all solutions begin to have a logical basis.
Most positive emotions and "goodness" are actually a result of genes which select for high time preference, as well as co-operation.  Empathy is also partially a spatial skill.
It's very interesting, as sentience itself is an emergent property of neural complexity, but convergent in its properties once it is achieved.  Look up dolphin and octopus studies.

Well, doesn't that depend on the purpose of their intelligence? We're made to be highly social creatures, part of society, but a robot wouldn't need to be. Intimacy with her husband is preferrable, but detachment from everybody else is also preferrable. Because this is outside of an evolutionary setting, things can be purposefully made to be contrary to natural selection. Octopi are pretty solitary creatures who don't get to have long term, real relationships, so even with their seeming similarities, they're different.

Haven't read the article yet, but the advantages of biological parts are energy efficiency and self repair. Even if we could do what the brain does, then won't be with the same efficiency and longevity. However, if I had to guess, we're rather going to use some biological muscles and/or skin at some point. Since this would be OT and speculative fiction anyways, I'll leave it to that.

# 53
>>7426
>Since this would be OT and speculative fiction anyways, I'll leave it to that.
Ehh, I'd say proceed if you're intent is legitimate discussion on it. AFAICT, we don't really have any other thread that even broached the Cyborg idea outside of the artificial wombs one.

# 54
>>7427
I currently think most likely thing to happen, related to parts of higher organisms, is that we might be using muscles based on cell from frogs, fish or jellyfish.
One problem here are infections. Working with material from humans might even be illegal in some countries and deployment in a cyborg is another story. Novel diseases can come from that, existing ones might spread. Containing it with antibiotics might cause resiliences.
Then, muscles might be easier to control than wiring a cell to a computer and communicate with it, a bunch of neural cells might even be another story.

This is all a bit pie in the sky, since we would need people to know about that stuff, have a hobby lab at least and then work on it. It's still more way to go, than using non-biological parts.
However, related the biology there's also a idea of using water kefir in the saliva to prevent other stuff from growing, and the idea of using a method to let our robowaifus release female  pheromones into the air. 

mlpol has a thread on biohacking in /cyb/: https://mlpol.net/cyb/1181 - Since we probably  can't cover all of that what might be necessary to do R&D in that area, we might as well link to forums and threads for the fundamentals.

# 55
>>7456
>infections, diseases
Yep, always an issue. 

An even bigger one to my mind is the simple maintenance problem of keeping organic tissue alive, whether as organs or otherwise. The kefir and pheremones idea is probably doable though. I'm also interested in some sort of coating that would sustain beneficial microbes on the robowaifu skin. There are going to be microbes there whether we want them or not, but we might somehow at least foster neutral or even helpful ones. Just find some kind of lotion that's helpful, just like in ''Chobits'' can probably solve this if we do a little research. And over-the-counter fragrances can be easily be stored and dispensed if desired. 

>Since we probably  can't cover all of that what might be necessary to do R&D in that area, we might as well link to forums and threads for the fundamentals.
Sure, linking to any other forums has been a long-standing tradition here. Heh, I'd be surprised if the ponies can manage much more unless they happen to have some sekrit embedded 1337 mad scientist type. Who knows? :^)

# 56
>>7491
>maintenance problem of keeping organic tissue alive
Okay, but in the best case scenario this would even be the reason for using organic material in the first place. 
Imagine we could build simple elements that would last very long if they get their liquid in which they are replaced when necessary. I thought about something like silicon rubber tubes with muscles inside, which would get new nutriens through a liquid. Waste is flushed away with the liquid. Maybe this would last longer than  air muscles or other material. Ideally these muscles would grow out of some liquid with the cells in it, then stop growing when not getting the right hormones or something. Then they could even get replaced after a while, hopefully by dissolving in their tubes, and then regrown by putting liquid with fresh cells into the body.
This is of course only a scenario how it would make sense, I have no idea if this is possible or how to get there soon. Of course, it also wouldn't solve the problem that these silicone parts would have to last for a long time either. Only replacing some other parts which might fail after some time.

# 57
>>7493
Obviously, trying to create, long, stringy muscles grown ''in situ'' is opening up a whole other **can of worms**. I'm generally opposed to liquids maintenance inside our robowaifus to the feasible degree possible. There are simply a **rapefugee-**boatload of problems that come along with the basic concept itself and we'd be best served not to open that door in the first place IMO.

And the idea of intentionally adding ''biologicals'' into the system? Well, that seems a little more like the lid to ''Pandora's Box'' tbh.

I know that the topic ITT, but the idea is an extreme stretch for something that's already out there so far it seems like getting to Mars and back.

# 58
>>7494
My take is rather that I want to use liquids anyways, for cooling and heat distribution. I also know that there are artificial grown bio robots, made in part out of jellyfish and such. However, I don't plan to go into that and don't think this is something where we can get fast progress. 
One more thought on this, I had on my mind, was comparing it to the cables of earphones. The cables often break on the inside, while the insulator isn't broken. If the inside was made out of something that would repair itself, it wouldn't matter. That's how nerves or muscle fibers could work. That's the best way to describe what I meant.
In the most extreme case it would be different from most or any Cyborgs we know from fiction. Maybe like a silicone doll on the outside, with artificial bones, the rest made out of silicone rubber and grown stuff, which would be originated from animals not closely related to us. 
Reminds me a bit of Lovecraft's creatures, but hopefully better looking and smelling, and without all the demonic stuff.

# 59
>>7498
Haha, fair enough. There's surely some merit and even possible benefits from exploring the concepts around integrating partial biologicals into our robowaifus. But, obviously, it will come at a heavy cost development-wise. Better appear to be well worth it before any serious effort is started.

# 60
>>7499
The development costs would be high if we would now try to get into it, on top of all the other things. On the other hand, in case someone would show up here, who would already happen to be involved in biology, then it will be good that we already have  some ideas laid out.

# 61
>>7500
That's true. But honestly, I can't think of anything we're dabbling into that I personally feel ''less'' qualified to discuss in earnest, and even barely to speculate on. My investigations into the biochemical foundations of life via molecular-biology studies and research frankly leave me flabbergasted.

-In software engineering, I feel vaguely like some kind of an engineer, at least part of the time.
-In character animation, I feel remotely qualified to judge acting-quality, having been a human being all my life.
-In electrical engineering, I've actually put together a thing or two under the close guidance of a good mentor.
-In mechanical engineering, I feel like only a bumbling dabbler, strictly an amateur. Mostly breaking things but ''sometimes'' succeeding.

But when it comes to ''life sciences'' (in particular at the molecular level) I don't think I understand much at all. Nor do most others I suspect -- certainly not the pop-science crowd. Never have so many LARPed so hard with so much ultimate comedy in the end.

Just some note I want to throw in here on the topic of long term feasibility of cyborgs. Slime molds could be interesting as an organism to build partially biological intelligence and sensors:

I have no specific idea how to use them. It's just that I think if anything is possible in that area, then it's without human cells,. There reasons I pointed out above. These slime moods have some features which might make them interesting as internal self-repairing sensors for pressure and maybe with some good ideas and gene engineering for building something like a (partially) biological brain.

It's certainly an interesting concept to intentionally harbor bio-materials within our robowaifus Anon. I'm unsure the feasibility of it being productive, but certainly the nanomachines designed by God are far surpassing anything feasible by mankind, so who knows?

>>13119
ideally, we'd reverse engineer these except to be sturdier. Also could help to integrate them into ourselves as anti-aging or protection against dementia if we are able to create nano-scale brain cell analogues.

Let's stay on topic please. The slime molds or some other cells would't be working inside a human body. The whole idea here is to say, if we ever get something partially biological it would rater be a Xeno-Cyborg than made out of human cells. Exactly because we won't have the risk of diseases jump over to humans, for example. Therefore and because regulations for moral reasons, it would also be easier to work with such materials outside of big corps and governments.

I meant: rather than have biomaterials inside our waifus we reverse engineer them, learn how they work and mimic it with nanotech. This is beyond anything '''we''' can do in a standard workshop, but if artificial '''neurons''' are conceivable in our lifetime however, it's a game changer.

Very cool design on the 'man-made neuronal system' graphic Anon. '''''"There's plenty of room at the bottom"''''', as an eminently brilliant man once said, so who knows? Who's to say we can't eventually devise analogs to many of God's biological designs that are 'good enough' to get most of the jobs done? Regardless, it's going to be interesting to watch developments along these lines, and I certainly hope we here can capitalize on them into our robowaifu's designs. Please pardon me if my previous post somehow impugned the basic idea, that wasn't my intent.

>>13151
All true. I hope the situation with 'standard workshops' changes and this can be easily achievable by nominally-competent men someday. **Of course, it will open up huge new, unrelated-to-robowaifus-or-AI, 'cans of worms' if it does! :^)**

Has anyone considered that the answer to all robowife questions is slimegirls? 
- Liquid form is both self-cleaning and fuckable
- AI can operate in a distributed manner throughout the substance the slimewife is made of
- can shapeshift from thicc to petite and back again, even during a single round of sex

-always wet!

take the slimewifepill!

na, if you want something that changes its appearance why just don't use VR?

We have an unofficial thread for cyborgs, including xeno-cyborgs: >>2184, which already mentioned slime molds as a possible material, but only internally. Also a thread for monster girls >>10259. Please choose how you want to realize something like that and then put such things into the right thread(s).

so we're going to go down the phyrexian route?

This could not possibly backfire.

Heh, very creative OP. I think our regular '''SophieDev''' beat you to it. I'm planning to merge your thread with our ''Bio Brain'' thread very soon. (>>2184)

Just wanted to mention these bacteria which seem to create nano wires: https://youtu.be/Hy7o78CrB-U
I don't like speculative or early technologies to pester every thread here, so I didn't put it into the one for energy systems. In the video it's rather about energy generation, but it only outputs a small amount. Since it's biology base and this thread here is for collecting such long shot ideas I decided to mention it here. The point is, bacteria creates wires, which one might use for sensors or such. Breakdown of wires and elastic sensors could be one of the bigger issues we'll face, so maybe one day this might be part of the solution.
