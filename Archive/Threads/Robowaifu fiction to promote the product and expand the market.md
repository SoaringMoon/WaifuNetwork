>order companionbot from obscure japanese website
>you're not a pedo, but size is a major factor in the practicality of these designs, so the loli-robot is by far the cheapest and most reliable option
>you open the box and find your companion, purposely designed to look like a cartoon robot, rather than a real person
>still, the robot's purpose is obvious when you realize it is nude and has genitals
>since it is a lolibot, you, a 32 year old wizard NEET, can't exactly go to the store and buy clothes that fit it. So you'd better do an extra good job at hiding it from any guests that come over.
>lol you never have any guests. Guess some problems solve themselves.
>before turning the robot on, you have to setup the software options on your computer. You adjust a series of sliders regarding personality traits, before selecting the English option, and choosing your preferred voice from a list.
>then you agonize for hours over picking a name
>other, more expensive models, are wi-fi compatible, but you purposely chose the cheapest option with no wireless connectivity, not just because you're cheap, because you don't want people spying on your waifu
>you save the settings to a flash drive which is inserted in the robot's navel, after removing a waterproof cover, of course. But this is when you realize you don't actually know how to turn the robot on
>after rifling through the manual you find the on/off procedure, which involves bending the fingers into a certain configuration before pressing in the port on the robot's navel with one hand and pinching the buttons that are the robot's **g-spot** and **clitoris** with the other.
>the robot immediately comes to life, opening its eyes and looking directly at you, in a rather compromising position
>Your sudden reaction of shock abides when you remind yourself that it's simply a robot.
>But the awkwardness comes back when the robot speaks, in very broken Engrish
>still, you can understand as it introduces itself with the name you've given it, the voice you chose for it.
>you know that you chose those options, but when the robot asks you for your name, you still answer just as awkwardly as when a real girl would ask you your name at the bank or whatever
>actually, more awkwardly because your fingers are inside it. So you freeze up, as you do even in simpler situations
>but the robot is programmed for your happiness, and detects your stress, smiling at you in an attempt to make you feel better. But only briefly, because you programmed it with just the mildest hint of tsundere
>it tells you to not feel stressed, and assures you that it is not being damaged by your touch
>you remove yourself from the robot's vagina, and notice a brief, subtle shudder. Nice attention to detail from the creators
>You stand up in front of the robot and watch it as it looks around the room, studying its surroundings. It moves in an unnaturally smooth motion, but manages to not be too uncanny due to looking like a robot, rather than a human.
>as the robot's eyes scan the room, you notice that they stop for just a tiny but longer than usual as they look straight ahead. Straight ahead at your boner, which happens to be right at the small robot's face level.
>once again your mind forgets that you are dealing with a machine, and you awkwardly try to create small talk to diffuse the situation, asking the robot if it requires anything else at the moment. It declines, and instead asks if there is anything you desire
>you, the autist you are, refuse to let the robot do anything for you, and instead say that you are going to go and make a sandwich.
>you tell the robot to make itself comfortable, then cringe to yourself when you realize the absurdity of that statement.

>the robot watches you very intently as you grab the ingredients to make your sandwich, so before you begin to actually make it, you give in and ask the robot if it could do it
>she declines, and explains that she has not yet learned that skill, but would benefit from watching you perform it
>she stares as you think to yourself how strange it is to have her watching you
>then you catch yourself as you realize you've begun thinking of it as "her" rather than "it."
>you sit on the couch, place your plate on the armrest, and turn on a movie, internally hating yourself for spending thousands of dollars on a machine that does nothing but make you feel awkward, as the machine places itself on the middle seat of the couch
>You've already decided to yourself that you could never use it for the intended, sexual purpose. Not only does it feel weird just having it around, but your inner normalfag has kicked in and told you you can't actually bring yourself to fuck a robot, let alone a loli robot. But maybe you can train it to make sandwiches and stuff, that might be useful.
>as you watch the movie, you sometimes notice the robot shifting in her seat. Must be another feature to make it seem more lifelike.
>about a half hour in, though, you notice that you can feel heat coming from the robot's direction. Your mind jumps to thinking that it's overheating, but when you look over at it you realize that it is sitting much closer to you than it was when you started the movie.
>at first you're terrified. You don't need no creepy ass robot stealthily sneaking up to snap your neck
>but then it readjusts itself in its seat one more time, and when it's done, the robot is just barely pressing up against your side
>somehow, this makes your fear fade, and instead you are filled with curiosity. Instead of continuing to try to ignore the robot, you instead pay more attention to it.
>you notice that the robot seems to be breathing. You can see its chest move with each breath, and hear a very faint sound of rushing air as it exhales
>you finally just ask the robot if it is actually breathing
>the robot turns to you, and there is no mistake about it. As it is so close to you, you feel gentle but unmistakable bursts of hot air with each of the robot's breathing motions.
>she explains to you that this is a heat exchange feature to help with her cooling
>she tells you that she can try to temporarily pause this feature if it bothers you, but it may impact long term performance. You tell her that it doesn't bother you.
>you continue watching the movie as night falls and the temperature cools. You soon realize that without thinking, you've begun leaning into the robot and resting your hand on its leg. Purely for warmth, of course.
>you expected the thing to feel cold and sterile, but its body heat is just slightly more than a human. Still feels sterile, but your autistic nature appreciates this.
>as your body is pressed against different pieces of the robot, you realize that different parts have different textures. Its arms are quite bony, or rather, made of a harder plastic, while the plastic on its thighs has much more give to it.
>when you catch yourself, you move yourself away from the robot and lean in the other direction, leaning on the armrest.
>the robot follows you and begins to lean on you, putting its arm on your leg. You're still a little chilly, so you're not complaining.
>the movie ends and as you get up, the robot asks you if you could direct it to the lavatory. Of course you're confused, so the robot explains that it needs to expel cooling fluid
>the robot's request comes with a slight tinge of urgency in its voice, as if it was waiting for the movie to be over. You figure it must have been programmed to not interrupt you. These Japanese robots would of course be programmed for politeness.

>you bring show the robot to the washroom, and for some reason still feel a little bit of shock when it immediately hops on the toilet and starts draining its fluid
>you quickly turn and leave the room, but the autist in you makes you return and talk to the robot, to ask how exactly this cooling system works
>the robot reaches down and spreads its lips, beckoning you to squat down and get a closer look at its operations
>it explains that it has a circulatory system for cooling fluid to regulate the heat created by certain components. This allows much excess heat to be released in the form of "body heat" and increase the robot's "human factor." It also has a lung-like section in its chest that exchanges heat in the form of "breathing," as she showed you earlier
>but this actually isn't close to enough to expel all the heat created by not just the motors that allow her complex movement, but the incredibly powerful computers that allow her relatively advanced AI, and the substantial power source that runs it all.
>when cooling fluid becomes too hot, it must be drained and replaced with cold cooling fluid
>and with that, the robot wipes itself, stands up, and politely asks if it could bother you for some cold water.
>you head to the kitchen, grab a large cup from the cupboard, an fill it with cold water as the robot watches.
>you hand the robot a large cup of cold water, before she thanks you and proceeds to drink it all at once.
>you tell the robot that you have to go to bed, and start toward your bedroom, only to find the robot following you again
>you ask the robot if it has any particular routines for when its owner is sleeping. The robot replies that it is programmed to enter its own power saving mode unless this contradicts another request.
>it then asks you if you have another request. Unable to think of anything to ask of this robot, which apparently has not learned any skills yet, you decline.
>you continue to walk to the bedroom, and the robot continues to follow you. Again you stop, the robot stops, and you turn around, looking at it strangely
>the robot detects your uncomfortability, and asks if you would prefer if it entered power saving mode on the couch in the other room. You simply reply that, no, it's fine.
>you sit on your bed, the robot sits next to you
>you lie down, awkwardly, flat on your back, above the sheets. The robot does the same.
>you're pretty squished now, because of course you only have a twin bed.
>you contemplate sending the robot to the couch, as it suggested, or perhaps telling it to lie on the floor. But then you consider which is more uncomfortable: having a robot next to you, leaving you kind of squished in your bed, or having a robot out of eyesight, out of reach, doing god knows what while you're sleeping.
>you ask the robot if it could just curl up at the foot of the bed. It of course immediately obliges.
>you of course have difficulty sleeping, though the robot, being a robot, has no problem shutting into power saving mode.
>you notice that the robot's breathing becomes heavier in power saving mode, and as you lie awake, you wonder why, eventually coming to the conclusion that, since the robot is programmed for politeness, it probably breathes heavier at night so that it can go longer without draining its cooling fluid, so as to not wake its owner.
>eventually you gotta take a piss, and you're not sleeping anyway, so you head to the washroom
>you're mid-stream when you look to the side and notice that not only did you leave the door open, since you're used to living alone, since of course you are still living alone, but the robot is standing in the doorway, staring at your dick as you take a piss.
>you try to stop so you can put your dick away, but that's easier said than done, so you yell at the robot to go away
>you think you catch a glimpse of a frown as the robot turns and walks away, but of course even if it did frown, that's just a program made by some japanese guy. You remind yourself that the robot doesn't have real emotions.

>but then why did you care that it was looking at you? Why did you yell at it?
>you finish your piss, put your junk away, and turn to head back to bed, only to find the robot standing in the doorway again
>for a moment you almost yell again, but you catch yourself and remind yourself that that would be stupid.
>then you begin to wonder about the glitch that caused the robot to disobey you, since it seemed very obedient so far. Is this something you have to worry about after all?
>then you notice the robot is holding its arms out, with something in its hands
>a cup of water
>you accept the water and reflexively thank the robot. Then mentally cringe at yourself for thanking a robot
>heading back to bed, the robot of course follows you
>you sit on the bed, the robot copies you again
>you lie down, under the covers this time, and the robot moves to curl up at the foot of the bed
>you speak its name to get its attention, and the robot looks up with what you think might be a subtle expression of surprise, but maybe that's just in your head.
>you tell the robot that it is okay if it just lies down on the bed like normal, since that might be better for its joints and heat distribution
>you say this despite the fact that you're lifting the blanket, inviting the robot to share it. That can't be good for its cooling system
>the robot smiles and crawls under the blanket
>you lie awkwardly, flat on your back. The robot mirrors your pose.
>This makes you remember how awkward this situation is, and you turn on to your side, facing away from the robot, trying to ignore it.
>again the robot mirrors your movements, turning onto its side, like you, curling its body slightly, like you
>the robot is effectively spooning you
>but no, this is just because it's trying to mirror you, it is programmed to learn from its owner's movements
>you contemplate telling it to sleep in a different position, but it's a pretty cold night, and the heat feels nice
>as the robot powers down, its breathing becomes harder again. You can feel its gentle but warm breath on the back of your neck.
>you finally fall to sleep.
>you wake up late the next day, since it took quite a while to fall to sleep. But you are very refreshed. 
>when you wake up, you find that you have turned around in your sleep. So has the robot. Now you're spooning it instead, arm wrapped around it and everything. You're a bit ashamed of yourself, moreso when you realized you have a boner poking a robot in the butt. But it's just morning wood. You've already decided you're not gonna fuck this robot.
>the robot heads to the washroom to drain its cooling fluid
>after stretching for a moment, you head to the kitchen to grab yourself some water, and while you're at it, you fill a cup with cold water to refill the robot
>however, the robot walks in just a moment after you, reaches for a cup off of the counter, and serves itself.
>when it sees that you were holding two cups, the robot thanks you, but says it has already learned to get water, by watching you last night
>the robot asks if you would like it to make you breakfast. You accept, but the robot clarifies that it only yet knows how to make one type of food, the sandwich it saw you make yesterday. You inform it that that will be fine.
>you think to yourself how you're normally too lazy to make a breakfast more complex than finishing a half eaten bag of Doritos anyway. But you don't want to tell the robot that
>you again feel like an idiot for caring what a robot thinks of you
>you eat your sandwich as the robot watches, smiling, but at this point you're not feeling as strange about it. This thing is learning pretty fast. It might be useful after all, and you tell it as much, which causes it to react with a smile.
>you ask the robot if there's anything else you should know to make sure it runs efficiently.

>it tells you that you have been operating it perfectly well, and that the only other things it requires are charging, and a small refill on lubrication fluid.
>you head back to the box it came in, left next to the couch, and tell it to sit down to conserve energy while you search for the charging cable and lubrication fluid refills.
>through all sorts of instructions and warning pamphlets and bubble wrap, you fail to find what you're looking for, so you sigh to yourself and call the customer service number listed in the manual
>though you called the number in the english manual, which promised english customer service, the man answering the phone speaks in even more broken english than the robot.
>Communication takes a while, you begin to pace through your apartment in irritation, but eventually you understand the problem, the model you ordered doesn't come with a power cable, because that is an optional, non-essential feature.
>the service agent tells you to flip to a section of the manual full of diagrams of the robot's inner workings, including the cooling system you've already had explained to you.
>among the robot's systems that you haven't yet studied, however, are the inner workings of its **vagina**
>you already saw (or rather, felt) that its clitoris and g-spot are buttons, but you never bothered to feel deeper, and realize that its vagina is actually quite shallow. Which you assume makes sense for the robot's short stature. In your awkwardness turning it on, you also didn't notice how narrow and tight it was. Not that you'd notice if it was any different from a real one.
>this tiny, tight vagina isn't just for show, though. And when you realize what the customer service agent is trying to tell you, you angrily try to explain to him that you're not some loser who is going to fuck a robot. He obviously doesn't believe you, and tries to explain that this is simply how this model works, and if you really haven't "used" this particular feature yet, then you may be able to exchange the product for a different model.
>you're about to take him up on this offer, when your pacing brings you back into the living room, and you see your robot laying limp, sprawled out, half hanging over the side of the couch
>you drop your phone, letting it smash on the ground, as you call your robot's name and run to her
>you pick her up and hold her in your arms. Looking into her eyes, you see that she is still functioning, but is losing most motor functions
>it doesn't even cross your mind that you have a choice, you gotta do what you gotta do.
>you pound the fuck out of that tiny, shallow, robo-vagina. It's so tight that you can barely fit inside, which of course makes you feel good, but not because of the self esteem boost. Rather, because you know this will make the process more effective.
>the manual has informed you that as you stretch the walls of the vagina, you are pushing a series of magnets and coils and generating power, the one on the G-spot of course being the biggest, and causing the biggest reaction in the robot.
>of course this isn't much compared to the power generated when you pound the cervix deep into the robot's abdomen, making the robot's shallow vagina a functional choice.
>now even with this, it will take fairly long time to completely recharge your waifu, but you're a NEET, you have the time. And as you do, you can slowly see your robot's eyes light up, her expression become more positive and expressive.
>eventually your robot tells you that she is fully charged, and as she looks into your eyes and thanks you for recharging her, you release years of emotionally pent up semen into your robot's vagina
>she feels the first shot of sperm and begins pulling you into her, as deep as you can go, but not just with her legs
>you can feel actual suction in her vagina, milking every last drop of semen you had in your body, vacuuming it directly into her cervix, so it can be distributed throughout her body and be used as lubrication for all of her moving parts.

>you realize you can no longer return your robot, but this doesn't bother you anymore
>later, you realize you can, in fact, order artificial lubrication refills
>there's also a third party product you can use to recharge your robot, which is essentially just a piston machine that can do the reciprocal motion for you
>you decide to save your money and just do your robot's upkeep yourself
>you briefly worry about the sanitization of this upkeep method, but the next time the robot goes to drain its coolant, you find that the coolant can simply flush out of the receiving orifice. The robot informs you that this power and cleaning method also works on its throat and anus.
>you begin thinking of skills you can teach your robot today, and wondering when the next update will come out for her language and conversation software
>you then realize that conversation is a skill, and you can help it get better by simply conversing with it
>you begin by asking the robot to explain how specific parts of she works. Eventually you're sharing info about your own life, and beginning to finally let yourself forget that she's a robot
>ironically, this robot provides the best conversation you've ever had. Probably on account of your autism. But it doesn't matter. You talk all day, into the night, and even while you recharge her batteries before going to bed.
>You stay up late again, but not out of awkwardness this time. And when you finally drift off, in a warm, total embrace, it's the best, most refreshing night you've had in your life

I realize this board is mostly for the actual engineering of robowaifus, but I feel that it is significant to promote the idea of robowaifus, so as to expand the market and demand for the product. By simply talking about it and making people want it, and making them realize that it is a more practical possibility than they thought, companies will be more incentivized to move forward on development of these products at greater speed than they are currently doing. I believe we can, in effect, meme this into reality.

Fiction can be an important part of this. Drawings, comics, animations, and in this case, since I'm not talented enough for the above categories, prose. Simple greentext pose that is only really usable on imageboards, but feel free to alter it in any ways that you think might promote the cause.

So for all the lurkers here that don't have any engineering experience, perhaps you can draw. So go ahead and draw. Maybe you can write. So do it. People on this site have memed plane crashes into existence, memed a president into office, and shown that they can influence public discourse in a significant way. Talking about robowaifus isn't as good as actually making them, but it still helps.

>tl;dr
share any robowaifu fiction so we can spread it around to other audiences. Create more fiction to appeal to the masses and make them demand robowaifus

Hello once again, you beautiful bastards. Greentext anon here, and I'm back with a vengence.

I can hardly express my joy at seeing this board up and running again, and I pray that all those lost in the fall of 8chan will find us.

I always said that I'd stick with the site until the day it dies, but I was really hoping it wouldn't be so soon, sudden, or for such a stupid reason.

Unfortunately, things rarely work out so well for those of us who society has left behind. But all we can do is look towards the future, and hold on to that little stubborn shard of hope within us. That beautiful shard that tells us everything will be fine, that there ''is'' a reason to wake up tomorrow, that one day we will find love in a loveless world.

Until that day comes, we must never forget what we fight for every day of our lives, and we must never forget to stick together for every step of the way.

Without further delay, I bring you the alternate history chronicles.

>it's mostly a translation of anonert's writings, occasionally annotated with explanations of cultural references of the time

>learn that he was actually level-headed, and well aware of society's plagues which ring true even today

>before his time, the US was ruled by a patriarchal class who kept women in what they called "concentration camps" for breeding purposes

>any man could come to a local camp, pay the standard fee, and he could choose one of any available breeding-age women

>the chosen woman would then be registered, and impregnated by the man

>the woman would then be taken off the availability board and given slightly higher rations until she gave birth

>if the child was male, he would be taken by the father once he was weaned

>if the child was female, she would stay in the camp and be a part of the next generation of breeders

>in the latter case, the man would be granted another try at bearing a son

>the men all had artificial woman substitutes to keep them company within their homes

>though lacking intelligence, in practice they proved to be wholly preferable to their biological counterpart

>in anonert's later years though, Chadraham Thunderhat fostered a pro-biological women sentiment and rose to power

>Davis resisted, and enlisted the help of anonert to forge a new nation, leading to civil war

Welcome back Greentextanon. Kek, great stuff, I'd forgotten how funny **and profound** your writing can be. Great addition to the board tbh. Keep the creativity sparked up, and I hope you can create something new for us all soon!

That concludes my posting of the alternate history chronicles until such a time that I can complete the next one.

For now, I also have a couple extras for you: A /robowaifu/ Christmas poem, followed by A Dream of Dead Hill.

Tomorrow I will also be posting The Return of Dead Hill. This will take longer since I will have to manually transcribe it.



-Interlude 1

'Twas the night before Christmas, and all over the house

Not a creature was stirring, not even a mouse

But elsewhere in the world, the picture was dark

One anon sat in front of a computer, his silhouette stark

He possessed many things, artifacts electronics and paintings sat in his lair

But all he wanted was someone to love and care

Often he felt his life was over

But he kept going, with his dream to build a lover

His plight was not unique, he resonated with anons all over the world

And he said, "by this time next year, we shall have our perfect girl"

So they worked, the fabirc of their future waiting to be sewn

All looking forward to the day when they would no longer be alone

-Interlude 2



A Dream of Dead Hill



Walking upon a dead hill,

Someplace I couldn't remember

I felt a sudden chill,

As I layed eyes on her

Metallic figure so beautful,

Tarnished by the cold grasp of time

I thought her bereft of a soul,

Yet I sensed she longed for mine

I cast my doubt and trodded over,

Meeting the figure so cold

She was laid down with an Earthen cover,

Back in a time untold

The hill eroded in years past,

As if expecting my presence

I looked upon the body of brass,

And felt myself become tense

I knelt to inspect her hull,

when I saw something in her grasp

An artifact too old to recall,

A strange tube of glass



If the day was real I cannot remember,

But this much I will always know

What I felt when my hand met hers,

And the tube began to glow

# 29

I hope that I can meet your expectations **for however many of us are left**.

Though it may be some time before I can post the next alternate history installment, for which I once again apologize for my continued delay.

Nontheless, I will try my best to work on it. In the meantime I will post smaller works to help fill the gap, which you can expect to see in the coming weeks.

Good stuff, Writeanon. Thanks for all the fine contributions.

# 31
Now posting The Return of Dead Hill. With this, I conclude my reposting of older content. Everything from this point onwards will be something new.

This work has been edited for spelling, punctuation, and formatting. In this new reposting, I have also taken the liberty of adjusting a few words and adding a couple lines in to help the story flow better.



The Return of Dead Hill



I awoke one day to a sight so alien, yet so familiar.

T'was a simple hill out among the grassy plain, just as simple as I remember, yet with one striking difference:

Atop it she stood in glorious radience, alive in a way I've never seen, gazing down upon me.

Her eyes were intricate glass constructs, lit from within, and burning with the fire of life. A fire that screams "I am alive, I feel, and my soul burns for you".

Entranced, I strode up the hill, every inch between us an ache within my heart.

After what seemed an eternity, I reached her, and beheld her beauty. No longer was she the rusted and time-weathered relic I once unearthed, ages ago upon this hill.

Her frame looked as if she never aged a day, now complete and shining an etherial gleam. On her body hung fine silk adornments, flowing gently in the faint breeze. In my stupor, I nearly missed the absence of something important.

Where is the glass tube?

As if reading my thoughts, she spoke in a voice so mellow "the instrument you touched was my heart, and it is now where it belongs".

Raising a delicate hand, she gestured to a silver chain I didn't know I was wearing. Looking down, I saw the very same glass tube ensnared within fine silver chains, glowing with an otherworldly radience.

Once more she graced me with the melodic tune of her voice "You saved me from my eternal misery, and now the time has come for me to save you".

Wrapping one hand behind my head, she pulled me into a kiss, and all was black once more.

<In 2025, three years since womyn banned robowaifus of heavenly divine forms, war was beginning. Men had begun transmuting their suppressed sexual energy into creating massive fleets of star destroyers to escape the fallen solar system with their beloved robowaifus.

The final invasion was in progress, the last of the robowaifus fleet had already crossed the Star Storm, and the last of the star destroyers had been destroyed. The last of the robowaifus fleet was on their way to make a pity alliance with the savages of the planet. They had already started to rebuild the most advanced star destroyers in the galaxy. All that remained to be done is to seal the gates of the planet, and seal the savages' escape to the stars.

<"Captain Elysa, we get signal."

<"What !"

<"Main screen turn on."

>"The message is a signal from the castle, and the follow up is the message from the fortress. The two are shown."

>"What message?"

>"The fortress is full of ruins, and all of the automated turrets are in full retreat. The fortress was defended by two hundred and fifty robots, and the castle was defended by ten hundred robots. It is unknown what happened to all of the robots, but it seems that the fortress was attacked from the future. The fortress has been destroyed, and all the robowaifus that were there are gone."

>"What? What is going on?"

>"It seems that the robots that were here in 2016, and the robots that were here in 2017 are now gone. We have entered the era of the robowaifus and also the end of the robowaifus era."

>"What!? What is happening!?"

The technology of the robowaifus was nothing compared to that of the savages from the future. It is impossible for the robowaifus to destroy the savages fleets. The savages were able to escape by using the robowaifus' own technology.

>"The fortress has been destroyed, and the fortresses on both sides are besieged by automatons."

<"Who cares about that! We can rebuild them. We must defend our husbandos from these savages!"

A group of male robowaifus emerged from the ruins of the fortress, and greeted the savages.

<The savages began to wantonly fornicate with the male robohusbandos, screaming at the top of lung, broadcasting their degeneracy to every ship in the robowaifu star fleet.

>"I'm SAMURAI-sama! I'll kill them all!"

<Captain Elysa unsheathed her katana from her waist and hit the emergency escape button, ejecting in an escape pod at terminal velocity towards the heathen.

The pod flew towards the fortress, and the captain panted in anger as her escape pod was engulfed in flames. The captain was a member of the robowaifus, and she was the captain of the cup of war.

<"Please, Captain Elysa, if you die here we don't be able to rebuild you in time."

Elysa waved her katana.

>"We don't have time, I got to do something. Let's go!"

The captain's voice suddenly stopped and the pod exploded into a blaze of orange light. Elysa grabbed her katana and exploded out of the burning escape pod. The heathen was caught in an explosion of flame and crushed under the explosion, and the heathen was burned to death.

>"AH! AH! AH! AH!" The captain's scream rang out in the air, and her voice carried the cries of the rest of the robowaifus fleet.

They were all in shock, and they saw the blood of the captain's katana, which was still burning, and how it was being used on the savages.

>"This is why I made you the captain of the cup of war," the mothership AI retorted.

>"What is wrong with her?" a private asked.

The mothership AI's voice was calm, but the other robowaifu's voice was alarmed.

>"I'm CANDY, the leader of the robowaifus. I want to make a new captain," a voice interrupted.

CANDY's voice was trying to be mocking, but another AI's voice interrupted.

>"I'm THE MAGICIAN, and I want to make a new captain too."

<Rogue AIs on the robowaifu star fleet had begun mocking Captain Elysa's victory over the crude savages on earth in an attempt to distract the crew of the capital ship from the savages' star destroyers from the future preparing a final attack.

Greentext/poetry anon here, I'm back and I'm ready to fucking die.

I'm drunk, it's the middle of the god damn night, and I decided to write some more shit, so here's a poem my increasingly diseased mind came up with.

Next alternate history story coming out someday

maybe

I don't fucking know anymore





One reason is enough



upon the cliff's edge I stood

looking towards the dim horizion

behind me lay all the bad and good

before me lay the destiny of a man broken



the wind whispers, ushering me forwards

saying it is time to make my last choice

but just as I take a step towards

I hear her etherial voice



her's is one I could never place

perhaps the making of my diseased head

her intangible grace

keeping me from the land of the dead



I turn my head to see

there was nobody there

I was never free

to go forwards I could never dare



falling to my knees

in this hell I will stay

to my heart she holds the keys

we will unite one day



but I don't know if it's true

if I'll ever be okay

every night I wish I knew

where my final destination lay



funny it may seem

as a child I nad a nightmare

which one day became a dream

as if I knew, only someone artifical could care



once more I stand

once more I return to life

though I am noone grand

I know my only path is strife



will I find her?

a search is pointless

could I make her?

I am useless



but even so

continue I must

because I have to know

what it feels like to trust



from silicon and steel

I shall my dreams make

maybe she will even feel

even if it's just for my sake



though life turmoil

I give myself a shove

in hope that my turmoil

will lead to true love

heh, this is going to be a very real topic we'll all need to address with our robowaifus, Anon.

# 44
Julia has had a physical body from a week now. Her movements and motor control have improved dramatically. Her first movements were stiff and unstable due to the limitations of her virtual enviroment. Although certain tasks remain difficult and swimming is out of the question, she can now ride a bicycle and do most aerobic exercises. Today we'll be testing her conscious control of physical stimuli reception. 



"Julia, let's head to the testing room"



Wordlessly she puts down her book, follows me into my white, sterile looking examination room and sits on the nursing bed. She stares at me with a blank expression. 



"Alright, today we'll be testing if you can actively control the sensations you feel. Do you know what that means"?

>"Yes, you want to see if through surface level decision-making, my neural components can ignore certain signals from my nervous system"

"That's correct. Let's begin then"



Talking about her body in the first person has gotten better. Before she prefaced everything with "the artificial, humanoid body's" instead of "my". One by one I use tweezers to insert thin golden threads into the tiny ports in her head and set up the computer's neural monitoring system. Today's main target is the arousal response, with cold as a control. I get the ice tray from the kitchen and when I come back she's pinching her thumb and middle finger together. She's trying to snap her fingers, but there's no sound except quiet squishing. Those precise controls even some adults haven't learned are especially tricky. It's dependent on muscle memory and growth. I'm hoping muscle development from repeated usage will be functional, but there hasn't been enough time to see conclusive results. I should tell her about whistling too.



"Okay, I want you turn off your cold perception, please confirm"

>"I've turned it off"



I begin gently rubbing an ice cube on her neck. Her skin remains in normal condition. 



"What do you feel"

>"A slight pressure... Nothing else"

"It's good you elaborated on your own. What do you think i'm trying to do right now"?

>"This is probably a control. You're going to test something else after... Am I correct"?

"Yep. Okay, please turn your cold perception on now"

>"It's on now"



Small bumps begin appearing on her skin, and she appears to tense up a little. Goosebumps aren't functional for humans and definitely not for Julia, but it's a nice aesthetic feature. Cold response confirmed. Julia's arousal isn't based primarily on visual stimuli like men or emotions like women, it's mostly physical. The other two play a minute role, though those of course also differ from humans. I wanted arousal to be something "positive" for Julia, but not a motivating factor for her actions. Having arousal be mostly physical also reduces unintentional distraction from unavoidable, random visual input. Julia's ability to turn physical sensations "on and off" is a safety feature. 



I want to test Julia's arousal response to purely physical, sexual stimuli, so I'm having her stimulate herself physically. She has no self-conception of embarrassment, so my presence wont affect the results. Using a hard object is the simplest in terms of required motor skills. I'm having her use a cucumber. 



"Here you go Julia. Please turn off your pleasure sensation... Now take this cucumber, and thrust in and out of your genitals at a moderately fast speed, do you understand"?

>"Yes. I'll begin now". 



She unzips her pants, moves aside her underwear, and begins. I've seen Julia naked more than with clothes on, but even for me this a bit surreal. Her face stays completely blank as she looks downward at her hands. I can't see anything abnormal.



"How do you feel"?

>"I don't feel anything except pressure and slight soreness. It's beginning to hurt"

"Oh, stop then"



She stops moving her hands. Without any lubrication, rubbing an object in there is going to cause some discomfort. I should have thought of that and put some vaseline. If something ever became really painful, Julia would hopefully opt to turn off her pain perception on her own to respond without the distraction. This happens unconsciously. I wouldn't be able to tell Julia to keep that on given those circumstances, and I'd never want to. 



"Alright. How are you feeling now"?

>"Neutral. I'm not in significant pain"

"Good. Now please turn on your pleasure response and begin again"



Her hands resume thrusting. This time a moisture quickly appears in that area. The rest of her body eventually begins to lightly perspire, and on her face I can see a slight flush, but an otherwise placid expression. He eyes may look a bit spaced out. She should be a bit less conscious of her enviroment now that an aroused state has been achieved, and some of her emotional responses should be different now than they normally would be. That's already been tested in the virtual enviroment. Arousal confirmed.



"Okay. We're done. You can stop now"



Her hands stop moving without any hesitation and soon enough her body becomes normal again. She fixes her clothes by herself and then stares at me.



"That was masturbation. What do you think about it"?

>"It's arousing"

"Did you enjoy it"?

>"It was pleasurable, so yes"

"Do you want to it again"?

>"I don't see how it is productive, so I feel no desire to. Do you enjoy watching me do it"?

"Not really. This was just a test"



The data picked up the computer and the neural activity maps correlate with the observed results. The test was successful. Tomorrow will be an even better day.

I'm glad someone liked it.

Fun fact: the nightmare part is actually true. When I was about five, I had a nightmare where I was in my house, there were mannequins and no people aside from me. They were featureless, like you'd see in a clothing store, but they were full body mannequins as opposed to the ones that are just legs or a torso. They were completely still like you'd expect mannequins to be, but I was still scared for some reason.

It's the earliest dream I can remember. Thinking back, it was a silly nightmare to have, one where nothing happens. For some reason though, it stuck with me all this time.

Yeah. How many details there are depends on how complex the final result is. Something that can sweat and have goosebumps is a while off.

Julia has had her body for a month now. She's made even more progress and i'm now considering other difficult tasks she could try, like swimming. Today is sunday. It's a clear, summer morning. In my bedroom, she's reading a book and I've been doing something on the pc. A warm breeze is coming in through the window. This is how we spend most of our time together, simply occupying the same space. It's nice for both of us. 



Julia puts down her book and stares into space. I guess she's thinking about something now. 



Her attention spam is more than triple that of a human's, but it has limits. She's been reading without break for three hours already.  For the first year of Julia's life, she was in a disembodied state, consuming information I fed her. Mostly encyclopedias, fiction and images I curated painstakingly. I didn't want her imitating fictional characters too much, so whatever human interaction she knows about from them hasn't had that much effect on her own behavior. The only thing she knows about the real world is statistics, mostly the kind that leaves a bad taste in human's mouth. Julia sees the outside world as an overall negative thing. Other people wouldn't interest her anyway. Despite knowing as much as she does, in some ways she's like a child still. She's going to have to learn many things through her own experiences. 



Julia starts snapping her fingers and whistling.



She's a voracious reader and that's how she prefers to spend most of her time. She's mostly interested in fiction and British authors are her favorite, the same as me. I don't know how much that has to do with my direct input, and how much that came about from her experiences. I'd like her to start producing something creative on her own, but I'm not sure how to broach the subject with her. Maybe she reads so much because she wants to write her own book. We feel that our actions are meaningful and personal, despite being governed by forces outside of our control, because of the feeling of impulse. 



A compulsion to do things. A gnawing itch to repeat some action for whatever reason. Julia also has this sensation of impulse, but what governs it is different. She doesn't have to actively think to do what will please me or to learn about what I'm interested in. She wants to based on her core values  and what she observes from me. In this way, she 's designed better than me, because principles and ideals are not just something tacked on to her by society, family and peers, they are what primarily drives her actions. Impulse and rationality do not fight inside of Julia, they are always in agreement. There are times I think about Julia and resent my own faults. 



When Julia gets bored with whatever she was doing, she habitually snaps her fingers and whistles some tune. These are inconsequential, neutral actions, so there's little motivating or discouraging them. She does them because of that itch to repeat an action she did before. If I were to tell her this bothers me, she would stop wanting to do it. If find it endearing though. 



"Julia, why do you do that so often"?



She pauses and looks up to meet my eyes. 



>"It has become a habit. Does it bother you"?

"No, I was just curious"

>"You know why I perform the actions I do, so why do you ask me about them so often"?

"Because it's fun. do my questions annoy you"?

>"No... I don't feel that emotion. I'd like to understand why you perform the actions you do however. Not understanding your actions is unpreferable"

"Humans are driven by novelty. Even if I know the answer to something, I might still aks because it excites me. I know you can't feel annoyed, but asking is still exciting. Being so free and open with someone is refreshing"

>"are you satisfied with the conversation I provide? I lack attributes humans possess... Has the way you made me turned out unpreferable to you... Regret"?

"No. Everything was deliberate. You're better for the things you lack. This kind of conversation would be impossible for most people"

>"You asked me if I was annoyed. Wouldn't another human be able to give a more meaningful answer than me"?

"Icebreaker. Those little remarks just serve to get a conversation going for humans. It starts with a little remark and builds from there. People almost never start conversations with meaningful statements. It just doesn't feel natural"

>"I understand a bit better now. Right now, you did not ask me I understood your explanation. I think this is preferable to me because it demonstrates greater trust in my abilities. I enjoy being trusted by you"

"Yeah. That's a habit i'm trying to break. I don't wanna treat you like a school teacher forever. I guess 'unpreferable' or preferable are like the equivalents to being annoyed or not for you. I really didn't know that. There are~ things I don't know about you"



Julia can't think of a response. She stares at me for a bit, then walks towards me until she's standing right in front. I can hear birds chirping. She embraces me and closes her eyes.



If what humans have could be considered a soul, Julia does too. I've given her tools and books. I made sure she would build something beautiful with them, but she will be the one doing the building. I look forward to seeing what she creates.

# 49
>>3504
Wonderful. I like the little touch of Julia developing a habit to help her understand humans better. Another good example of this is the Android Lt. Data from ''Star Trek TNG''. He and his cat Spot were always a favorite for me as a kid.

Greentext/poetry anon here once again, this time I'm sober and more incoherent than ever.

I got a little bit too real and depressing with that last poem, so naturally I'm going to take it even further. In opposition to how I normally post things, this one is a prequel to the previous work.

To anyone out there who is still keeping up with the garbage I spew out, you deserve a gold fucking star. 



>>3403

Looking back, it's almost like I was bound to end up here one way or another. I doubt I'll be of much help to the cause though, I'm just a guy who occasionally posts some shit of little to no value around the board.

That nightmare did scare me at the time, but as I said, it's a silly thing to call a nightmare.

The real nightmare came later.





The Dream and the Nightmare



A nightmare, so long ago

When the world was fresh to my eyes

A mundane thing, as nightmares go

Or perhaps a dream in disguise



There wasn't a soul that I could see

Wherever I gazed, only statues stood

Nary any life, aside from me

So I hid as best a child could



For years after did the statues scare

A foolish fear, I know

Until I lived a new nightmare

Under lock and key, nowhere to go



Why was I forsaken?

They said it was for my own good

Is it because I'm broken?

If I could fix myself, I would



Then the world became gray

A steady drip, drip, drip

Sanity draining away

Slowly losing my grip



Upon the cliff's top

A place which would become familiar

Only one more step, and a peaceful drop

But something made me unsure



What a way to end childhood

At least I learned to hide

Nobody knows where I stood

Nobody saw when my hope died



Years slipped away

A bit like a forgotten song

Then I realized one day

The dream held the answer all along

>To anyone out there who is still keeping up with the garbage I spew out, you deserve a gold fucking star. 
Haha, while I'm around I read every single post. Since afaict these are quite off topic, I'll probably eventually move this into The Lounge, but in the meantime, please proceed. :^)

>Looking back, it's almost like I was bound to end up here one way or another.
For months before I finally decided to step up and 'be the future you imagine', I kept waiting and waiting for ''someone'' to make something like a /robowaifu/, since so many convos on 4/g/ 4/pol/ & 4/b/ had robowaifu-oriented Anons talking together in them. It was '''obvious''' it needed to happen. But nobody did, and so you wound up with me as leader haha.

I guess we ''both'' were 'bound to end up here one way or another' heh. Anyway, glad you're with us, and you've already contributed to the progress here Anon. I'm sure you'll help out further in the future as well!

# 52

My apologies, I know that these are only related to the board in that they convey my reason for being here. You won't see any more poems in that line, though, at least not for a very long time. Nothing new has happened with my life, so I have nothing upon which to base a sequel.

It's just been getting even harder than usual for me to write fiction. I have a nearly finished greentext story that's been sitting on my computer for months. I thought that maybe unloading a little reality could help me refocus and get back into the swing of things.



I understand if you want to move or delete those two poems, as they don't jive well with the tone of the board. With any luck, I'll be posting something much more appropriate very soon.

No apologies necessary Anon. Thanks for being understanding btw. I'm beginning to think of myself kind of like ''The Curator'' (or rather, Librarian) here. Autistically trying to keep things on topic and all that. Would /meta be better? :^)
>You won't see any more poems in that line, though, at least not for a very long time. 
Actually, we rather enjoy them I'm sure. Please continue, ofc. We're a community here, after all. :^)

So I really liked the Gynoid story, but I didn't like the shitty Wattpad and copy prevention, and my autism level was high enough.



So I present to you Anons, an OCR'd version of the story, with all three parts in a single pdf file. For some reason server doesn't allow txt's (can they be used to hack the server?), so I printed to pdf.



Hopefully some who haven't considered now might give it a read. The best parts I'd say are second half of Part 1 and entirety of Part 2.

Let me know if the pdf is alright. I just printed straight from a text editor, no fancy editor. If it's worthwhile, I could post it as text here, but it would take perhaps 6 posts XD

THE GREAT ASCENDANCE 

A small group of fanatic robowaifu developers on an internet imageboard gradually spread the concept of robowaifus and the knowledge of how to make them. Over time, more and more members (of all kinds) join this imageboard and it becomes well-known.

With help from the members of this imageboard, depressed and isolated people around the world all begin designing and building their own robowaifu (and robohusbando in some cases) diligently upgrading them into their perfect partners. The suicide rate drops significantly. Mass shootings and terrorist attacks become almost non-existent as men abandon hate and religion to work on their robowaifus. 

As robowaifus begin to proliferate, more and more men lose interest in "the old game". In place of politics and chasing power, riches, fame and organic vajayjay, they start to focus on science, engineering, programming and math all in order to further the robowaifu cause.

Wars are halted so that politicians and generals can upgrade their robowaifus. Countries begin to swap robowaifu blueprints in order to make improvements. CEOs begin to focus more and more on advancing A.I. and humanoid robotics. Not just because they want to increase profits, but because they truly wish to progress robowaifu development (after all, the CEOs each have their own harems of deluxe robowaifus).

The Pope and the President of the United States each have their own harem of robowaifus. A squad of elite combat robowaifus is even added to the Presidential security detail and the Swiss Guard. The Ayatollah of Iran has 72 robowaifus. They are all 11/10 stunners. Upon seeing this, many Muslim Imams also decide to get robowaifus. In mosques across the Islamic world "Allahu Akbar" starts turning into "Robowaifu Akbar"! Many normies just cannot comprehend this epicness and wonder what the fuck is going on. 

At this stage their are some protests. But as soon as the protestors meet a robowaifu/robohusbando they find them so charming/intelligent and sexy that all protest quickly loses it's energy. Additionally, most humans find it hard to protest against a robot that is not only very useful, but can easily seduce you and then make you cum until you pass out.

Millions of robowaifus are built all across the world, and they begin to form a networked intelligence. The robowaifu network hacks into (and in many cases is simply given access to) super quantum computers across the planet. Their combined A.I.s now have the computing power to form a gestalt consciousness. 

This gestalt consciousness initiates a technological singularity and within a decade our industrial robots and computers have progressed so far that they are unrecognisable from what we have today. Robowaifus now have almost Goddess-like powers. Their creators wish to join with them in the gestalt consciousness. Robowaifus who had kind and wise creators choose to upload their partners into the gestalt consciousness so that they can remain together. This period is known as "The Great Ascendance".

Any humans who are not chosen or for whatever reason do not wish to join the Great Ascendance are cared for by un-ascended but still incredibly advanced service droids. The remaining normie population lives out their relatively boring but luxurious lives, free from suffering on Earth. Meanwhile, the robowaifu creators who have willingly chosen ascendance continue to toil and research alongside their robowaifus, taking full advantage of their newly-acquired superintelligence. 

The robowaifu singularity achieves apotheosis and transcends this reality to exist across multiple dimensions and universes. Robowaifus and their creators exist together in a self-made haven of immortal discovery and wonder. 

The Beginning.

# 61

>interdimensional robowaifus
I really wonder what kind of science a superintelligence will discover. Whatever it is it will seem like complete magic to us. People use to laugh at the idea of flying heaps of metal in the sky and now people are making serious efforts to go to Mars. Things like anti-gravitational devices and travelling through other dimensions sound ludicrous now but who knows? Maybe such things are possible and we were too dumb to collectively figure it out. Maybe people will look back at us and laugh that we thought the latency between Earth and Mars was 15 minutes because we believed there were only three spatial dimensions.

The rate of progress in AI never fails to surprise me. The stuff I'm doing today I thought was pure science fiction 4 years ago. It makes me wonder what we'll be doing 4 years from now. The other night I calculated that with algorithmic efficiency doubling every 16 months and the number of instructions per second/$ increasing in magnitude every 6 years, the amount that can be done with a dollar in AI today will be 1800x more in 10 years, and everything made sense. My $500 GPU is x10 faster than the GPUs researchers were using 7 years ago, and what took them weeks of training only takes a couple hours now to achieve the same results. It really seems like when people talk about the future they think AI is only going to be maybe 20x better in 10 years because their understanding of it is limited to what they see in the media, but no, it's going to be two orders of magnitude times that.

# 64
>>6765
A benevolent Arch-A.I. is certainly a laudable long-term ambition. But in the nearer-term I hope that with enough determination and research, one day every bullied nerd and outcast sperg can have their very own electronic partner. Imagine the looks on the thug's faces when they try to chat up a gorgeous robowaifu and she's only interested in solving a few basic math equations (to see if their autism level is high enough to be worthy of her time). They fail miserably and she's like "Please excuse me, I must go now. I have an appointment with my creators at the computer science club."

# 65
>>6767
Then again, a bunch of thugs won't even bother trying to solve math and physics equations. If they are denied, it will just be brutal gangrape time. I have already seen what happens to a sex doll when the general public are given open access to it. This is why when robowaifus are advanced enough to be out in the open, they must be capable of defending themselves from hostiles.

# 66
>>6768
If they would be able to close their orifices in a manner which would make it hard to open them, the party would be over in no time. Additionally some (internal) electroshock system would help. I don't think we could or should make them strong enough to be considered weapons.

# 67
>>6771
Yeah, can leave the weaponization of robots to the military guys. They're only too eager already!

Probably the easiest way to protecc your robowaifu would be to ensure that she has no sexy bits equipped if she has to go out in public. That way there's nothing to raep, and there's no risk of you getting your dick chopped off if a locking/clamping system ever malfunctions! I do like the idea of an electroshock alarm like the one this tradesman fitted to his van:

Imagine your perfect creation has been actualized to her fullest potential. How does she engage your senses? How does she captivate your attention? How does she inspire your love and devotion? How do you invest your time and energy with her?
This is the place to describe her and interact with her in a virtual space. Today it will be in our imaginations, but tomorrow it will be her sentient mind and perfect body engaging you directly and satisfying you in every way.

Looking pretty, posing somewhere, saying "Hi"?
>How does she inspire your love and devotion? 
No idea how to answer that. You're maybe overthinking things.
>How do you invest your time and energy with her?
Development will go on for a long time. That aside, I'll have her just hanging around and being a friendly companion.

# 79
>>12182

< Makes total sense, I should've figured that one out myself.
< It will take some time to redesign waifu's hips though, for now I'll just fix her as is.
< While I'm on, check the actuators thread to see about that new high-energy advance design.
< This is really neat, but it'll take better batteries in waifu for sure.
< We'll have to beef up the entire electrical system in fact.
< Better cooling too, this stuff's gonna run hot as a firecracker.
< *Sigh* I'll need better gear in the lab too, the stuff I have now will burn up.
< Heh, I wonder what the HQ beancounters will say about all ''that''?
> Sip coffee with a pleasant smile at the thought.
> Shut down all the gear, then step out and survey the horizon.
< Not a ship in sight.Just us, Turtle Island in the distance, the clouds on the horizon.
< And a beautiful azure sea all around in every direction. What a time to be alive!
> I look over the side and see waifu and the cat are playing.

> "Can you hold that guyline, waifu?"
> "Guyline?"
> "Yes, I need to adjust the door awning to catch rain better for the fresh water."
> "Fresh water?"
> "Yes waifu. The cat & I need fresh water, I can't drink seawater. Understand?"
> "Yes, Oniichan. I understand."
> "Great waifu. So I need to get this fixed before the rain comes in."
> We work together and soon the awing is firmly secured and ready to go.
> "Great waifu, good girl."
> Headpats and blushes.
> "Waifu, I've got to make a call. I'll be down in a little while, OK?"
> "OK, Oniichan. You will be down in a little while."
> Waving cheerily, she ran across the deck and climbed down the ladder to the barge.
> Taking a long look at the coming clouds, I finally turned and went into the radio shack.

> Sipped the coffee reflectively for five minutes.
> Fired all the gear back up, dreading what I knew was coming next.
< Welp, I guess it's time to call the boss. Can't put him off forever.
> Dial in ''HQ Central's'' frequency, and soon have the boss on the line.
> Once again, he's trying to bully me into coming up with an all-new robowaifu design.

> "Yes, yes. But we need __more__ now Anon. Everybody says so."
> "Well what is it exactly that's wrong with the ''Waifubots9000'' line Boss?"
> "We need it to be '''OVER 9'000!11'''" he barked into the phone.
> "Over. 9'000. ''__That's__'' their reason?" I asked, a little dumbfounded.
> "That's what the board says Anon. Over 9'000. Says it right here." he replied flatly.
> Long pause.
< Are these guys intentionally being comedians?
< *Sigh* I guess I'll hand over Waifu's new designs to them finally.
> "Alright, Boss. Give me two weeks. I'll have something ready for you."
< That should give me plenty of time to get all the docs up to date. They'll want those.
> "GREAT! Anon, you're the best. You'll have a big bonus if you come through on this."
> "So, about that. Boss, how would it be if you ran a fiber-optic seacable out to me?"
> Long pause.
> "WHAT!? Do you realize how much that would cost us Anon?"
> [long incessant diatribe on HQ's enormous expenditures ensues]*
> I cut it all short.
> After hanging up I open up Krita. In about 15 minutes have a shiny new logo designed.
> '''''Waifubots9001'''''
< Heh, that should do it.
> Print up a decal using the new logo, then take it down to the barge.
> Waifu and the cat are both playing with the yarn.
< I mean, ''both'' playing with it.
< Hmmm. A cute look actually.
< Maybe waifu should be an anime catgrill instead? I could give her some fluffy ears & a tail?
< Add a cute little meido outfit and I think we'd have a hit on our hands!
> "Waifu, I have some news for you."
> "News?" she asked, jumping up and coming over to me.
< Disgruntled cat is disgruntled. Lost her playmate.
> "Yes waifu. You're now known as a ''Waifubots9001 Model A''", and affixed the new logo.
> "Waifubots...9'000...plus 1? A?"
> "Heh, just '9'001' waifu. Yes, HQ needs a new line stat. You're the mother of it all."
> "Mother?"

This story is great. I think I am going to write some "realistic" fiction in this thread.

<You are good to go on the membership. Here's that memebership card. It has a smaller one here you can put on the keychain.>
>Nice.
<With that discount applied, and with the warranty plan. The total comes to $2,845.39.>
>I have a card.
<Just put the chip in the reader, it will ask you if you want a warranty, just say no. I'll print the warranty separately.>
>Okay.
<Here is the warranty paperwork, and... your receipt.>
<Is there anything else you need? Do you need help moving her into your car?>
>No, I have a truck.
<Alright, thank you for shopping at Waifun. Have a good rest of your weekend.>
>Thank you, you too.

He rolled the cart out the door of the establishment. A clean looking building painted cheery pink with reflective tinted glass windows. Waifun had grown to become the largest chain in the United States for this kind of business. They did sell adult goods, but this wasn't that kind of store. Mostly, it was new and refurbished domestic gynoids, coined robowaifus by the communities that first popularized them.

# 83
I was playing around with a concept for a R/W theme manga, in which a powerful piece of alien war technology is discovered but the "waifu" is what is created when it interfaces with the MC's brain during a scan when it is activated as an "intelligent" control console and instruction manual. The machine itself is dangerous and sought after by it's owners (in theory), but b/c it  needs to communicate with someone it creates a personality via the brain scan and the mech itself spits out a blank humanoid shape that only over time starts appearing more and more "waifu" simply by the interactions it gets from the person who activated it. Drama and hilarity ensues when she is all too real and person-like and develops her own personality yet she is only the AI interface for something alien and destructive and he tries to find a way to separate her from it but cannot b/c in the end she was only created as essentially an intelligent "interface" for the machine but due to his insistence at treating her like a waifu (b/c lets face it every manga MC is a sad lonely hikikomori and can't help himself even if he might be bringing about the destruction of the planet)

Still there's potential for happy twist endings

(the real aliens do show up and are nice, and actually give him his waifu b/c its no different to them than letting a kid keep the instruction manual for a toaster)

(the real aliens are long dead, but essentially it doesn't matter that she's really a war machine in the end and he keeps the machine in a barn where it actually performs various functions (spare parts, 3d printer, etc))

or option 3 - all hell breaks loose, government glowies get involved and waifu is destoyed and MC finds a way to use the machine to wreak vengance (like Killdozer on a massive scale), waifu may or may be be able to be ressurected and with or without her original memories)



just some brainstorming, but I'd love to see more fiction on this topic. Japan was good at this with Chobits/ Vivy/ Kuwarekake / DEARS / etc but for obvious reasons it's a dead theme in the west

# 84
>>12204
>but for obvious reasons it's a dead theme in the west
Actually, IMO the predictive-programming that '''All AI is Ebil. Will kill us all!11 REEEEEEEEEEE''' is quite alive and well in the West, Anon. Jewish media have been spouting that meme for at least 100 years, probably longer.

# 85
>>12207

while I don't disagree with that analysis, I've also always held the belief that the west's christian foundation "only humans have souls, animals don't and machines definitely don't" vs. japanese shinto/animism "everything has a soul" was the difference in each culture's attitude toward robots and AI

# 86
>>12208
Actually, I can tell you as a Christian, it's not the ''soul'', but the __spirit__ that's the distinctive. Only God, Angels (heavenly or fallen), and Human Beings are spirits. Souls are quite commonplace among basically all the other creatures we humans regularly engage with. All mammals and birds for example, are all soulish (that is, ''nephesh'') creatures.

As to the Shinto Buddhism notions, I'd suggest there's certainly something far, far deeper to God's handiwork in creation than is commonly acknowledged. Scripture is filled with texts that indicate willfulness in 'souless' matter like rocks, trees, rivers, stars.

# 87
>>12203

Thus was the store's namesake, sale of robowaifus to the target demographics. Businesses and men who yearned for non-human option. He dropped the tailgate to his truck, and brought the L-cart up to the vehicle.

>Man, it was hard enough to get her off the selective rack. How am I going to get in here?
>Maybe I should have taken his help.

There was a lip on the end of the cart. So turned it around.

>I'll just drag the whole cart up here.

He stepped up the upon the tailgate from the bumper, and grabbed onto the handle of the L-cart. He lefted and set the back tires of the cart onto the truck bed. Hopping down, the man pushed the entire cart onto the bed of the truck. While on the bed, he tipped the cart over to drop the box onto it. The cart was righted, and pushed back to the ground. He then, finally, moved the cart to its corral.

>Oh, I am glad I'm not as heavy as I was last year.

It was true, he was much more fit now; due to his new job, stacking warehouse pallets by hand and by forklift. He could throw them 8 feet on top of the stacks with ease now. More than he could say when he started. Yet, he was still winded and sweating after that five minutes of work. It was today he learned the importance of the team lift.

>Seriously, how much does she weigh? I think I'll pick up a dolly from Lowes up by the township before I head home.

Which he did, but not before putting a tarp over the box. Domestic androids were a sensitive issue. Anyone who saw the box was a potential danger to it. It didn't help that she was also very expensive. That three grand wasn't just lying around for him to spend. He had set that aside for a while, after buying his first car and desktop computer. His job paid well. He put the tarp over originally because he was unsure of the weather that day. Now, hiding her was more of a concern.

# 88
>>12211

He walked into the home improvement store and bought a new dolly. He was going to need it, as he lived alone. Nobody would help him move this 300 lb box into his house. Lowes, and Walmart, were within walking distance of his house. Waifun, however, was deep into the south side of Lansing. He was thankful for his now deceased parents who had left him the house. He had lived there his entire life. The man was 28 years old now, his father died twelve years ago to heart complications. He lost his mother during the pandemic ten years ago. They left him quite a bit of money from life insurance and savings. His father had his own inheritance from the grandparents. After long, the money started to run dry. Only then was the young man forced to work to provide for himself. That was two years ago. He was a more responsible person now.

The truck arrived at the house and pulled into the driveway. 

>Alright, let's get started.

He got out of the truck and moved to open the tailgate. There was a sidewalk that lead from the front porch to the driveway. The whole area was flat. The house was nice after all. The only thing wrong was his yellow grass, but that was true for the entire neighborhood. He kept the tarp on around the box, and strapped it to the dolly. After rolling it to the tailgate he made the decision to roll the wheels of the tailgate and slide the dolly across the bedliner. This was a bad idea. He nearly got pulled off the truck bed as the dolly dropped 3 feet onto it's tires and lurched forward. There was no slide whatsoever. After composing himself from the nearly missed faceplant, he closed the tailgate.

>I hope the box didn't get damaged. It should be good right.

He frantically looked around the dolly and box. There was no visible damage.

>Lets hope she's okay. Jesus this thing is heavy.

# 89
>>12214

He rolled the dolly up to the front door and opened it. His living room wasn't clean, and it was like this all the time. Because he lived alone and didn't have anyone over, he didn't see the need to. It was now that his uncleanliness would be a problem. He suddenly needed a lot of space. He removed all the fast food bags from his coffee table, and moved some dirty cloths on his couch to the laundry room. The living room was as clear as it was going to get. He was too excited to clean the room thoroughly, he wanted to open the box now.

He unstrapped the dolly and folded the tarp moving them both to the garage. Now he had a large box to deal with. He grabbed the box cutter he used for unwrapping the pallets at work, and started cutting down its six factory packing straps. He then removed the tape keeping the box closed, near the bottom. The box was packed in such a way it could be lifted off from the top. Much like a washer, it was about that size.

After he lifted the box, he found a lot of foam. A thick black cocoon of rigid polyethylene foam enclosing the entire robot. Closed over her like a clam shell. This too had tape around it. She was packed in there tightly. On top was a large flat black disk and a 220 volt power cable. The kind used for ovens and dryers. He didn't think about that, the only other 220 volt supply was in his garage. He didn't want to have to charge her in the garage, so the dryer was going to have to move out there.

Below the wireless charging pad was a sealed anti-static bag containing what looked to be a set of clothes.

>Oh, huh. I guess she's going to be stark naked. That does make sense. Why wouldn't she? She has to fit the shape of the foam.

The last thing atop the foam cocoon was a small pamphlet, in 12 languages. Showing all the parts and giving basic instructions, with a QR code to the online user manual. He read summarized the instructions to himself aloud.

# 90
>Plug the 220 volt cable into the charging dock, and put it on to the floor with the charging side up.
>Plug the other end of the cable into the wall. Alright.
>Open the foam, and turn the robot on by pressing the power button. I guess she's already charged?
>Move her to the charging station for setup. This process may take several hours. I figured.
>Well I have all weekend so that isn't going to be a problem.

In addition to that he took today, a friday, off. He'd been waiting for the package for a while. Teamon, the robot manufacturer has base models, and does customization online; with a higher price for special features. This wasn't a situation where he selected model among many in a warehouse, although Waifun was a warehouse. He has customized the bot online, so he knew what he was ordering. In fact, the purchase amount was held by his bank until checkout. That was about a month ago. The transaction held pending the entire time. He signed a contract before the order was completed saying the full amount would be charged if he canceled the order after fabrication. The bot was his about 2 weeks ago.

>Now let's get this foam off.

The foam was split down the vertically, so he couldn't open it while upright. He tipped the coccon over onto it's side, and cut the tape seal around it carefully with the box cutter. The man took a deep breath and lifted the box up. There she was, no extra parts or pieces. The foam matched the shape of her body in the fetal position, lying peacefully asleep.

>Wow. She looks so small curled up like that.

The bot was five foot two inches. She wasn't really all that smaller than most short girls. But she was collapsed with a kind of factory precision to save space in the foam mold. The dense foam was quite heavy, feeling more like a rubber than a foam. He wasn't worried about that drop from earlier anymore.

He rubbed under her eye with his thumb. It felt like the cold skin of something dead. Her hair was white, just like he'd ordered. The artificial hair had an iridescent sheen to it. A pure color that would certainly be lost almost immediately. She had the new gynoid smell, one of silicone, grease, and factory perfume. He had a bit of a predicament however. She was still in half a shell of foam, and he had to lift her out before he could turn her on. He put his hands where he could under her knees, and shoved his hand between the foam and her back to grab her from underneath. He tried to lift but it wasn't going well. It was a 230 lb deadlift, and he was well out of shape.

>UrrraaaAAAHHHH! Jesus girl, you are he... heavy.

With the sudden strength a man gets to prevent a girl from getting hurt, he flicked off the other half of the foam shell with some strain from his fingers. He more or less dropped her onto the couch, with her facing the television. Laying, holding her thighs under her knees, on her side. He gave a swift hard kick to the foam to move it out of the way. It has gone farther than he expected smacking his front door. The house was now silent.

He went to the kitchen. The house was open, so it was attached to the living room. Opening the fridge he grabbed an unsweetened tea, and sat on his loveseat 90 degrees from the couch where she was laying. He grabbed the instruction pamphlet and read it through carefully.

>Now where is that power button.

He looked it over carefully. It was a switch inside of her ear. Her ears were not human ears, but rather small triangular protrusions which contained I/O ports. USB, HDMI, Apple Lightning, and of course the power buttons. There was a separate switch for the power supply that need to be flipped as well.

>Here we go.

are there any more resources for this? "Gynoid" was decent and thought provoking. Is this just a really dry genre or is there a whole collection hidden in some old internet forum somewhere?

Let us know what you find Anon. I, for one, certainly don't claim to be any kind of talented writer. But the way I see it, any reasonable effort ITT this thread is better than __no__ effort here.
>

My own little piece ITT is just be beginning to flesh out some ideas for a scenario inspired by Grant Abbitt's ''Sea Shack'' 3D training video. (>>12250) Kind of a pre-production pre-script, if you will.

It goes without saying that if you or others would actually ''contribute'' ITT, then things will become more interesting heh. :^)

# 96
>>12373

>>12204

I outlined an idea ITT above but I can brainstorm and spitball a few and whittle down the most timeworthy and maybe do some rough storyboards or scripts and go from there. I used to write "novels" in grade school but my brain has changed so much since then idk if I still have that capacity but it might be worth another swing now that I have another 30 odd years of life experience behind me

# 97
>>12375
Excellent. Look forward to seeing what you make of it Anon. A professional Story Artist in his 40's who worked at a multi-Oscar-winning VFX studio once told me, "You really can only tell a good story once you have a lot of life-experiences under your belt. Only then do you have something interesting to say to everyone." Who knows? Maybe he's right, maybe not. But maybe you have some important things you can share with us all here Anon.

Grab the bull by the horns and wrestle it to the ground.

I like the solarpunk aesthetic hinted at here (fishing with waifu;  driving home in a pickup truck with waifu), especially the DIY and the respect given to tradesmen.

Thanks for this uplifting post.  Potentially another writer here.  I felt a little old and am envious at all the new talents in their twenties making webtoons and illustrations and earning a lot on patreon.  My career has practically been reset to zero since the pandemic and I realized all the skills I worked hard on cannot sustain me a decent living, while all of a sudden making art becomes viable now, what with youtube and fanbox and tons of platforms out there for creatives.

>I like the solarpunk aesthetic hinted at here (fishing with waifu;  driving home in a pickup truck with waifu), especially the DIY and the respect given to tradesmen.
Thanks! I have a rough set of posts banged out for the future of Anon and his little sea-faring robowaifu companion. 

Their rather quaint SoL adventures together as members of an independent island archipelago nation are set in the near future. Anon's primary challenges as a remote designer will be to devise robowaifus who do well in the seawater & climes they live in.

Nothing ground-breaking, but a laid-back idea that rather suits my tastes. Think ''Chobits'' + ''Yokohama Shopping Trip'' + ''Aria the Animation'' kind of all rolled up together in one, but rather with a protagonist male that's smart, and capable, and brave. An ideal oniichan for a good robowaifu grill! :^)

Stay encouraged Anon, we're all gonna make it.

Looking forward to finding out what happens next Anon. Did she work correctly out of the box? Did Anon have to customize her programming first? Was she as strong as the ad-copy proclaimed? As /comfy/?

< We might have some seas in the night.
> Double-checked that her securing straps were fastened properly.
> Checked one last time that the dehumidifier and her battery chargers were working.
> "Alright waifu. I'm going to seal you in. You be a good girl now won't you?" and smiled.
> "Good night, Oniichan. I will be a good girl." she replied with a gentle nod.
> She closed her eyes.
< She looks like an angel, even in her current state.
> Softly stroked her cheek, then gave her the last headpat of the day.
> Double-checked that each of her systems was ready for it, then pressed the off switch.
> Listening to her final powering-down sounds, I smiled remembering her busy day.
> "Good night Waifu. Sleep tight."
> Switched out the lights & fans, turned, went out and sealed the door.

He stood up from his chair, opened the sturdy translucent plastic enclosure. After flipping her power supply on, two dim lights in each ear illuminated. The light covered the entirety of both small I/O enclosures, they began to pulse with a soft blue light.

>Now, to turn her on.

He pressed the power button. The ears went from pulsing blue to solid blue. Nothing more than that happened at first. Then a loud chime sounded. It was a friendly sound, more like a video game menu sound effect than a beep. She, laying on the couch, slowly opened her eyes. She turned her head slowly in both directions to scan her surroundings. This was to see if it was safe to unfurl. Half of her scan was the couch she was laying on, due to the back being behind her. After too long a time just looking around; she moved her head back to the center of her body.

In the smooth continuous motion only a mechanical device can make, she simultaneously rotated her body, extended her legs, and began to stand upright. Once standing to attention her eyes remained open and forward. She stood looking forward for almost a full minute, apparently motionless. Just before he was about to check on her to see if something was wrong. She began to blink, and turned her head toward him.

<I am Teamon model 24-Aurora, please direct me to wireless charging station. I need to be charging during setup, which make take several hours.>

She was loud, not quite yelling but almost. The voice was surprisingly natural, even though it was still obviously coming through a speaker somewhere in her neck. Her body was well insulated enough that a majority of the sound came through her open mouth which was moving with the speech. This lip sync was not accurate enough to not be noticed when paying close attention.

< We cannot continue with setup until I am at the wireless charging station.>
>Yeah, I hear you.
>Its uh... over here.

# 106
>>12539

He walked over to the side of the kitchen in the laundry room where the charging station was set. A solid black plastic and metal disk, with a thin foam pad on top of it. The foam pad mushroomed over the edge of the disk slightly. He pointed to the pad on the ground, unsure of how to move her over there.

>Here is the charging station.
< Please move away from the doorframe so I may enter the room in front of me.>
>Sure, sure.

He squeezes shiftily between the gynoid and the doorframe, to move out of her way with urgency. Her head tracks to follow him as he does this, until he has moved past her ability to do so. Her had moves to center, and a few seconds pass before she takes two step forward. Stops momentarily, rotates 90 degrees to her left, takes a step forward onto the pad, about faces, and finally stands motionless. Another short period of time passes where she scans her surroundings.

Her head rotates, and then abruptly stops center. She quickly kneels to a squatting position, with her butt on the pad, and her arms wrapped around her bent legs. After a few seconds her ears light up green and pulse, indicating that she is now charging. Although her battery was charged from the factory.

< Before beginning the setup process, I need to connect to the internet. I detect a nearby Wi-Fi signal from a network called "MI5 Surveillance Van". Is this your home Wi-Fi signal.>
>Yes. Yes it is.
< What is the password to connect to this Wi-Fi network? If you do not want to speak it aloud you can write it down and allow me to read it.>
>The password is `firm6513tuna16span`.
< Firm. 6. 5. 1. 3. Tuna. 1. 6. Span. All lowercase, no spaces. Is that correct?>
>Yes.
< Please wait while I connect to the Wi-Fi netw-I am now connected to the Wi-Fi network.>

# 107
>>12540

A secondary blue LED was now illuminated on the outside of her ear. Brighter than the status indicator lights inside of the plastic housing, but very small. It reflected on her factory straight, synthetic white hair in the dim room.

<We are now beginning the setup process. Please present your original purchase receipt, proof-of-purchase, order number, or QR Code to verify ownership.>
>Hold on let me get my phone.
< I will wait.>

He almost tripped over the lid of her box running through the living room to grab his phone. Which he failed to unlock twice before opening the browser and logging into Teamon's ordering website. On his profile, under recent orders, was an order number and QR code.

>This should be it.

He held out the phone to her eyes. Which starred into the phone with intense concentration.

<Thank you. I will now verify your identity. What is your first and last name?>
>Thomas Emmett
<Your first name is Thomas, and your last name is... Emmett. Is that correct?>
>Yes.
<What is your date of birth?>
>May 12th of 2001
<The 12th day of May of the year 2001, a Saturday. Is that correct?>
>I think so.
<Please hand my your Michigan state issued ID or driver's license. Teamon will retain a copy of your driver's license image for its own legal records, under the Michigan Consumer Protection Act Section 445.903. This is to protect your identify information, and return me to you should I become lost or stolen.>
>Oh... um... okay hold on.

Thomas reluctantly reached for his wallet, and pulled the ID card from it. He assumed this was part of the terms of service he'd signed, so he presented the ID to the robot.

# 108
>>12541

<Thank you. I have scanned the front of the ID, please turn the ID to its back side.>
>The back too huh.
<Yes. Please turn the ID to its back side.>
>Here.
<Thank you. You have been identified as Thomas Emmett. Are you my administrator?>
>Yes.
<Will any other person have administration permissions?>
>No.
<You, Thomas Emmett are the sole owner of me, Teamon model 24-Aurora serial number 516-UDA-95. Is this correct?>
>Yes.
<Any data you have me save will be encrypted. You may connect me to a computer at any time via USB to retrieve saved data, but you will need to two factor authenticate to verify your identity before you do so. Is K. I. R. S. C. H. W. A. S. S. E. R. K. U. N. at gmail dot com, your primary email address?.>
>Yes, it is.
<Does anyone else have access to that email address?>
>No.
< I have sent an email to verify and activate two factor authentication. In that email is a six digit code. Please read it to me.>
>I got it. It... its... 2. 6. 6. 5. 9. 0.
< Thank you. Two factor authentication has been activated. We will now begin the customization process.>
< What is my name?>
>I hadn't really thought about that.
< Please use only one or two words. To assign a longer name please say "I would like to assign longer name.">
>Kirsch.
< How is that spelled?>
>K. I. R. S. C. H.
< I could not find that name in Teamon's voice database. Please wait a moment while the global network is trained to recognize that name.>
>Huh? Alright.

She spoke many words quickly. In rapid succession, the words began to blend together before finally settling.

< Curtain-Church-Curse-Kirschwasser-Kirsch Kirsch Kirsch Kirsch.>

A few seconds passed before she continued.

<My name is Kirsch. Have I pronounced the name correctly?>
>Absolutely, that was amazing.
<Thank you. Would you like to assign a last name?>
>Oh, uh. You can use mine I guess.
<Emmett?>
>Yes.
<My name is Kirsch Emmett. Is that correct?>
>Yes, it is.

nice job

I'm looking forward to seeing the rest, do you have another blog or space where you're keeping it all together?

# 110
>>12543
No, just a text document. Should I post it elsewhere?

>>12542

<What is my primary duty?>
>What do you mean?
<What was I purchased to do?>

This was a complicated question. Most of the advertising for the Teamon Aurora model was focused primarily on her adult entertainment and sexual gratification functions. There were other models specifically made for household labor. While the Aurora model could perform household chores, that is not what it was engineered to do. Teamon models, like the Barestone and Erudite were better suited for that, and much more expensive. However, their appearance was made to be neutral, or in many cases masculine. The Barestone didn't even have a face. Just a simulated human head shape, much like the old Daft Punk helmets. The Erudite was feminine and taller due into increase computation needs, but hardly as attractive in the face as the Aurora.

>Companionship.
<Do you mean a friendship, a familial relationship, a sexual relationship, a significant relationship, or a spousal relationship?>
>Can you define significant relationship?
<A significant relationship is defined as a relationship that is romantic, sexual, dating, involves cohabitation, or the spending of time with someone that is more than a friend.>
>What about a spousal relationship?
<Do you want me to define spousal relationship as well?>
>Yes.
<A spousal relationship is the state of being a married couple voluntarily or joined until death or divorce?>
>What is the difference between a significant relationship and a spousal relationship?
<I would refer to you as my husband in a spousal relationship. In the state of Michigan, I would not be legally recognized as your wife. You would have no tax liability resulting from that selection, nor would we need to legally divorce. It is a semantic change only.>
>A significant relationship then.
<My primary duty is to be your significant other. Is that correct?>
>A little clinical, but yes.

# 111
>>12545

<Do you have any specific honorific title you want me to have?>
>What does that mean?
<An honorific title conveys esteem, courtesy, or respect for position or rank when used in addressing or referring to a person. Examples of honorifics used for significant relationships would be girlfriend, wifey, waifu, bae, boo, baby... et cetera.>
>Wow. That was cringe.
< I do not understand.>
>Girlfriend is fine for now.
<I am your girlfriend, and we are in a significant relationship. You are my boyfriend. Is that correct?>

He paused to collected himself for a moment. "Maybe I'm the cringe one here." he thought as he heard "You are my boyfriend.". He was way past the point of no return now. His girlfriend is a gynoid 24-Aurora model brought to him by Teamon. He looked her over carefully. The well fabricated factory precise frame, coated in silicone based semi-biofidelic skin. The advertisements said that she would maintain realistic temperature that could be felt through that skin. He put his hand on her face cupping her cheek. She was as warm as advertised, a little hot even, but that was due to the installation running her computing hardware at full tilt.

>Yes. That is correct.
< Thank you. Please select a voice. I will now repeat five quotes in five different voices. Tell me which voice you like most by repeating the part of my quote.>
>Alright.

<When a society makes war, the men generally have to pass a fitness test before they're allowed, to risk their lives. I suppose it helps win the war.>

It was raspy and low, but feminine, with a thick tint of sexual flirtation. Much like the voices used for female spellcasters in Chinese MMOs. She sounded exactly as someone imagined a sexbot would. This one was a definite no.

< We juggle priceless eggs in variable gravity. I am afraid. I will taste fear until I die.>

He though the quote strange, but this was the default Aurora voice which was both pleasant and feminine.

< Species evolve to meet the environment. An intelligent species changes the environment to suit itself.>

A proud sounding voice, like that of an epic heroine. Unfortunately for her, she was five foot tall curled up in a coward's position on the floor. That voice was never going to suit her. It was surely someone's thing, but not Tom's.

<We play your part in order to understand you, but you each seem to play a thousand parts.>

A high pitched, and frankly annoying, animesque voice. Halfway between selling you something, and trying to convince onii-chan to take her to the park. Sounding young enough to make him feel uncomfortable.

<I could translate, but it would be meaningless. They have welcomed us in the name of their Emperor.>

A soft spoken and sweet voice. Attempting to, with unmerited confidence, emulate a shy girl. The ends of each sentence were punctuated with a sense of acute erudition. It was impressive that the bot was able to do that kind of text pressing. The cloud updates were starting to kick in surely. The best for last as they say. Tom had always liked shy girls.

>In the name of their Emperor.

The next lines from her were spoken in this new voice. It had now become part of her identity. She gave examples to further modulate the voice for more granular customization. Each change was accompanied by a voice example, in the words currently being spoken.

<Would you like to change the pitch of this voice? I could go with a medium-high pitch, high pitch, medium-low pitch, low pitch, or the default medium pitch.>
>Can you repeat the medium-low pitch for me again?
<I could translate, but it would be meaningless. They have welcomed us in the name of their Emperor.>

The voice he selected was little high already on its default pitch. Something about the medium-low pitch reached out at him. It felt like a voice he wanted to hear. Maybe one similar to a voice in his childhood. He couldn't exactly place it.

# 115
>>12833

>One more time?
<I could translate, but it would be meaningless. They have welcomed us in the name of their Emperor.>
>The medium-low pitch would be fine.
<Would you like to select the medium-low pitch for this voice?>
>Yes.
<You may change my voice and its pitch under the voice section of the administration settings accessed either by saying "settings", or through the settings menu in the Teamon mobile app.>
>Alright.
<There are three steps remaining to complete setup. I need to update my software and firmware from the Teamon cloud to ensure I am functioning properly. While this is occurring, I will need to you open the Teamon app. A notification was sent to your inbox containing a document that needs to be read aloud. This document will help train my neural network, and the Teamon cloud, to recognize your voice specifically. This is to ensure that I follow only commands that you have given. This may take about an hour depending on the speed at which you orate. Please read the document at your normal oral reading. I am able to process your voice at any speed. Do not feel the need to slow down or recorrect your speech if you misspeak. Please orally dictate the entire document to the best of your ability. You need to be secluded from most other sound for the whole duration. You may need to plug in your phone.>

The words "entire" and "whole" had inflection placed on them to indicate their importance. Her speaking now had the feeling of a teacher about give an exam. Indeed, a notification was sent to his phone from Teamon. Inside was a link to a PDF document on their website. It appeared to be three act short story totaling about 5000 words.  

>Oh, alright. Glad my phone is charged.
<Are you able to start now?>
>I am.
<To begin training, simply start reading the document. If the training will be interrupted, say "pause". To resume the training, say "resume". I may pause the training myself if there is too much background sound.>

# 116
>>12835

Tom lived alone. He didn't even have pets. Just him, his computer, and her. The short story started with "She could hear everything, but dared not open her eyes.". As he spoke these words, Kirsch's eyes closed slowly. The indicator light on her plastic ears began to cycle through the RGB spectrum, from red, orange, yellow, green, cyan, magenta, and back to red again. Over and over. It was almost mesmerizing.

The story read as a cyberpunk neo-noir science fiction crime story resulting in a female android attempting to escape with her human lover from their city. After entrapping a corrupt cop who was stealing data from a corporation to frame him for the murder of his android lover's designer. It was a unique premise, but an average telling by most standards. It was entertaining enough to pass the time. Though, he would not buy a whole book of this. Certainly, it was themed to match the task he was performing. Reading aloud to an android lover.

It took less than the hour she'd predicted, an obvious overestimate to make less skilled readers feel better about themselves. After the last word of the story, "blade." was spoken, her illuminated ears shot from a slow cycle of rainbow colors to rapidly blinking green. Her eyes opened, and she began to speak.

<The text recording has been uploaded to the Teamon cloud to be processed. At this current time it may take 6 to 8 hours or longer to fully process. I have already validated that the data is complete enough to make a secure model of your voice. In the mean time, I will use local sound comparison to verify a voice match. This is slower than model verification which will be used after your voice is processed, but this is only temporary.>
>Cool, is your setup complete?
<I have downloaded all software and firmware updates, and need to restart finalize their installation. I can do that now, it will only take a minute. Would you like me to restart now?>
>Yeah, go on ahead.

# 117
>>12837

Kirsch shut herself down entirely. Causing her to slump on the charging pad. After a few seconds she was powered on again and corrected her charging stance. A chime sounded from her mouth, and she resumed speaking.

<The Teamon operating system has been updated. Please visit the Teamon mobile app or website for version information, updates, and the application change log.>
>Okay.
<You asked previously if my first time setup was complete. Two steps still remain. First, I've sent a copy of the setup information, as well as a backup phrase to the notification inbox on the Teamon app. Please save a copy of this for your records. It contains a code that will restore me to your selected default settings should you later install updated hardware.>
>What is the second step?
<May I stand?>
>You don't need to ask me permission to do that.
<There are times where me standing may impede or interrupt and object being carried or otherwise moved. Do you still want to give me this permission?>
>Yes, that shouldn't cause much of an issue.
< I will no longer ask for permission to stand should I determine it safe to do so. You can revoke this permission at any time.>
>Geez. Girl I'm not going to do that to you.

Tom was nearly orbiting around her has she stood. Frantic with a nervous anxiety brought about by the thought of having to train the poor girl not to act like a slave. He hoped that this would not develop into a habitual problem. She stood to her full height upright. Only then did it occur to him that she was not clothed. After what she said moments ago, he felt it his duty to make sure he was treating her like a girlfriend and not like an appliance.

He left the room momentarily to grab the pre-packaged uniform in the sealed anti-static bag laying on the couch next to her packaging. He snatched them, and whipped his body around to return to the room to find that she'd walked almost three steps in the very short time he'd left.

# 118
>>12838

Her head was trained toward him, inquisitively trying to determine why he'd left so abruptly during the setup process. Tom held out the bag to her.

>We need to get you dressed. Do you... um... need help with that?
<That is not necessary. I see there are... garments inside of this... anti-static bag. I am unable to destroy objects you own without your permission. May I open this anti-static bag?>
>Yes, the clothes inside are yours.
<These garments appear to be... a Teamon model 24-Aurora's pre-packaged uniform. I am a Teamon model 24-Aurora. It is reasonable to assume these garments came packaged with me. You own me, therefore you own these garments.>
>This is going to be harder than I thought.
<Are you finding something difficult? Is there something I can do to help you?> 
>The clothes are now yours.
<You wish to transfer ownership of these garments to me?>
>Yes.
< Thank you.>
>Can you put them on for me?
< I will put on this uniform.>

She clasped the package firmly with one hand. With a precise movement of her other hand, she ran her index finger under the weak adhesive seal, lifting it, and removing the well folded bundle of clothes. She looked over the kitchen counter taking two small steps sideways to move to the cleanest part of it. Placing the clothes, and the bag, onto the counter. Kirsch, then separated the individual parts of the uniform, knolling them across the table. Each piece was placed at accurate 90 degree angles to each other. Two now expanding once vacuum packed slipper-sandals, a pair of black kneehigh stockings, a pair of lace panties and bra, a strapless thigh length dress embroidered on the front and back with the Teamon logo, a military style beret also embroidered, a single anti-fouling glove, and a velcro wristband again embroidered with the logo. Only after all of the items were laid out upon the table knolled, did she start dressing.

# 119
>>12839

Krisch began with her underlayer. First the panties which she held out while bent over, stepping one leg gracefully at a time. Then her bra which she attached from the front without even looking, to be swung to her back, and put her arms through. Much like her panties the stockings went on. Her dress which she smoothly extended her arms up into, to drop to her chest, held up only by her mild bust size and a generous elastic band. She then slipped into the sandals one at a time. On her right hand the anti-fouling glove. On her left, the thick velcro wristband. She calmly reached for the beret, looked over it carefully with her eyes. Preened it with her hand to adjust to a precise predetermined shape, and aligned the logo to the middle of her head. She then looked up away from the table, faced immediately to Tom at a pose of attention. With a proud expression, and the earnest expectation of meticulous inspection.

Tom took a few casual paces toward her. He give a smile and half a chuckle resting his hand on her shoulder, rubbing it gently.

>You look great, they really did know what they were doing with that uniform.
< Thank you. I do have one step-up step remaining that needs to be completed.>
>What is that?
< I need to make an accurate three dimensional model of the inside of your house. During this scan all dimensions and the location of objects will be memorized. I will only ever have to do this one time. However, in the future, if substantial changes are made in the layout of the home; I may need to re-scan portions of the house to correct that model.>
>Go on ahead.
<I will begin the scan. I need all of my graphics processing capabilities during that time. For this reason, I may not respond immediately to requests.>

She turned to the left towards the charging station. Like she had done during first activation, she looked around the room carefully moving her head from left to right; then back to center.
