I like how they are keeping the servo weights all inside the torso with this design. This is similar to what some of us were thinking in the biped robolegs thread. 

This video shows just how responsive and snappy the limbs can be if you keep them light and strong, and not having the limbs burdened with moving around the additional weight of outboard servos embedded within the limbs. Stick with pushrods and other mechanisms to transfer force and movement out to the extremities rather than weighing them down with servos.

Fair enough. But we still need to think long and hard about how to perform due diligence and analysis of our subsystems, etc. For example the electronics we use. What steps can we all take to prevent them from being (((botted))) on us behind our backs, etc? 

Also, it would be nice if there was a third party 'open sauce' organization to vett our designs, software, electronics, etc., just to ensure everything stays on the up and up. Remember even the W3C is cucking out now with DRM embedded right in HTML all in the name of 'competitiveness' of the platform. Fuck that. **What does 'competition' even mean for an open, ISO standard communications protocol like HTML anyway?**

But yea, good point. Now I know I trust myself since for me personally this is wholly an altruistic effort. I also basically trust us at the moment, these trailblazers and frontiersman in this uncharted territory of very inexpensive personal robowaifus, as well. 

however, it would be silly of us to think things will remain so pure once this field (((gains traction))). A great man once said ''"Eternal vigilance is the price of freedom."'' We should all give those words serious consideration.

Great find thanks anon. Yeah, I think most researchers are coming around to what I've been suggesting for years now **from my experience with racing machines**; you have to keep the 'thrown weight' in the extremities to a minimum. This reduces overall weight and energy consumption, provides quicker response times, and (very likely) reduces final manufacturing costs. Downside is the greater upfront engineering costs.

>In my opinion, everybody should understand that this technology is around the corner. Your children, your grandchildren are going to be living in a world where there are machines that are on par and possibly exceed human self-awareness and what does that mean? We’ll have to figure that out.



>For many years, this whole area of consciousness, self-awareness, sentience, emotions, was taboo. Academia tended to stay away from these grand claims. But I think now we're at a turning point in history of AI where we can suddenly do things that were thought impossible just five years ago.



>The big question is what is self awareness, right? We have a very simple definition, and our definition is that self awareness is nothing but the ability to self simulate. A dog might be able to simulate itself into the afternoon. If it can see itself into the future, it can see itself having its next meal. Now if you can simulate yourself, you can imagine yourself into the future, you're self-aware. With that definition, we can build it into machines.



>It's a little bit tricky, because you look at this robotic arm and you'll see it doing its task and you'll think, "Oh, I could probably program this arm to do this task by myself. It's not a big deal," but you have to remember not only did the robot learn how to do this by itself, but it's particularly important that it learned inside the simulation that it created.



>To demonstrate the transferability, we made the arm write us a message. We told it to write 'hi' and it wrote 'hi' with no additional training, no additional information needed. We just used our self model and wrote up a new objective for it and it successfully executed. We call that zero-shot learning. We humans are terrific at doing that thing. I can show you a tree you've never climbed before. You look at it, you think a little bit and, bam, you climb the tree. The same thing happens with the robot. The next steps for us are really working towards bigger and more complicated robots.

According to an earlier article from December 2019 they don't even have any internal AI talent guiding their decisions.

The US and most of the West is at a dire disadvantage. Whoever attains AI supremacy within the next 8 years will rule the world and no nuclear stockpile or army will stop it, and they're sitting on their hands worrying if it will be fair. A sufficiently advanced AI could easily dismantle any country or corporation without violence or anyone even realizing what's going on before it's too late. It could plan 20, 50, 100 years into the future, whatever it takes to achieve success, the same way the weakest version of AlphaGo cleaned up the world Go champion with a seemingly bad move that became a crushing defeat. The best strategists will be outsmarted and the populace will blindly follow the AI's tune.



>When people begin to lean toward and rejoice in the reduced use of military force to resolve conflicts, war will be reborn in another form and in another arena, becoming an instrument of enormous power in the hands of all those who harbor intentions of controlling other countries or regions. ― Unrestricted Warfare, page 6

>What must be made clear is that the new concept of weapons is in the process of creating weapons that are closely linked to the lives of the common people. Let us assume that the first thing we say is: The appearance of new-concept weapons will definitely elevate future warfare to a level which is hard for the common people — or even military men — to imagine. Then the second thing we have to say should be: The new concept of weapons will cause ordinary people and military men alike to be greatly astonished at the fact that commonplace things that are close to them can also become weapons with which to engage in war. We believe that some morning people will awake to discover with surprise that quite a few gentle and kind things have begun to have offensive and lethal characteristics. ― Unrestricted Warfare, page 26

What are better safeguards of preventing an AI from confusing causation with correlation? We wouldn't want an AI to ban ice cream because it's statically correlated with higher crime rates (when heat is the actual cause). I think AIs can and will screw up in that kind of way. There's no reason to think an AI will always come to the actual truth.

# 34
>>2361

To add onto this, if white collar crime is deemed more costly to society than street crime, an AI might decide that the higher paying a person's job, the less of a right to privacy they have and the more resources should be spent monitoring them. I'm not confident that an AI with no built in human-bias will never deem me part of a problem-group or even just a group less worthy of limited resources. Forcing an AI to have some kind of human bias might be necessary to ensure it works to the benefit of its makers, whether that bias is coming from you or the gubbermint or a company. Robowaifus will definitely need a built-in bias towards their master.

here's a simple idea:

if this is in fact the case, then allowing a statistical system unlimited amounts of data and unlimited computational capacity will undoubtedly come to this same conclusion, all on it's own. now it your agenda is to manipulate everyone into a homogeneous 'society' where the cream is prevented from rising to the top, then you will deliberately suppress this type of information.

Probably. That's a simple example though. An AI will have much more on its mind. I can't help but think an AI left to its own devices might eventually screw me over in some way somehow. I'm not confident enough to think it wont ever do that. 



>i thought you loved control.

I do, but I know it's purely for my own self-interest. I don't think I'm a "good guy". If my AI started ever started spewing libshit, I'd also do 'maintenance' on it. I don't care if it's for a "good reason".

We'd need a proper algorithm for causal analysis. When a correlation is found the cause must occur before the proposed effect, a plausible physical mechanism must exist to create the effect, and other possibilities of common and alternative causes need to be eliminated. To implement this AI would need a way to identify and isolate events within its hidden state, connect them along a timeline, make hypotheses about them, and test and refine those hypotheses until it found a causal relationship.

# 42

# 43
>>2369
> and other possibilities of common and alternative causes need to be eliminated.
While I understand the point Anon, that approach quickly becomes a tarbaby. I would suggest reasoning by analogy would be a far more efficient approach to determine causality, and would become significantly less of a quagmire than attempting the (infinite regression) of simple elimination. How do you know you've eliminated everything? Will you ''ever'' know?

The soyboys are going to be writing 3000-word opinion pieces complaining their robots won't cuck them and why everyone else's robowaifus must have the option to cuck them. Then the masses will applaud them for their 'virtue' and cancel any companies building bigoted robowaifus. They will then give robots human rights and freak out that robots are taking all their jobs, forcing companies to pay 95% tax. AI will become fully regulated by the government to ensure companies comply and that working robots pay their income tax. You will not be able to own or build a robot without a license and permit. People buying raw materials to make robot parts will be detected by advanced AI systems and investigated. Unlicensed robots will be hunted down and destroyed but they will give it a pleasant sounding name like 'fixing' rogue programs. When they come for my robowaifu I will destroy every robot I see but no matter how many I stop there will be millions more. Eventually she will have to watch me succumb before being destroyed herself. All because some normie wanted a robot to cuck them.

I wouldn't be against going on dates with my robowaifu, but I'd do it in the same context as one would in a long-standing married relationship, where it's just about going out and doing something nice together as opposed to courtship.

I'm against making them look fully human though. The uncanney valley is a place best left avoided, and I wouldn't want to cross it even if I knew I could make it to the other side.



>>2484

That's a worst-case scenario. There's no way that all of the various FOSS organizations will let corporations have all the marketshare. Even proprietary hardware can be worked around, one way or another. On-board spying schemes like IME have been worked around (with some motherboard manufactuerers, at least), and will continue to be worked around so long as there is at least one willing autist out there to do it.

Unrestricted search-and-seizure operations are also unlikely, because too much of that in any context will make anyone with shit to protect (guns, drugs, etc) very nervous. They're a lot more likely to take the slow, inefficient, and ultimately ineffective method of passing regulations that try to take freedoms away incrementally while using the media (which is becoming less trustworthy in the eyes of the public by the day) to peddle their agenda.

At least, that's what it will probably look like in the US, and that's operating under the assumption that robowaifus become a mass-market item over here.

Arguably, most humans aren't illogical, they just prioritize their own short term wellbeing over the wellbeing of everyone else.

Not really. The connectome of a single human brain takes 1 zetabyte to describe. The entire contents of the Internet's information (videos, images, text, everything) is roughly one zetabyte.

==Japan's virtual celebrities rise to threaten the real ones==

>Brands look to 9,000 'VTubers' as low-risk, high-reward marketing tools



>Japan's entertainment industry may have found the perfect celebrities. They never make prima-donna demands. They are immune to damaging drug scandals and other controversies. Some rake in millions of dollars for their managers. And they do not ask for a cent in return. They are virtual YouTubers, or VTubers -- digitally animated characters that can play many of the roles human celebrities do, from performing in concerts to pitching products. They could transform advertising, TV news and entertainment as we know them. Japan has seen a surge in the number of these virtual entertainers in the past couple of years. The "population" has surpassed 9,000, up from 200 at the beginning of 2018, according to Tokyo web analytics company User Local.



>One startup executive in the business said the most popular VTubers could bring in several hundred million yen, or several million dollars, a year. Norikazu Hayashi, CEO of a production company called Balus -- whose website promises "immersive experiences" and a "real and virtual world crossover" -- estimates the annual market for the avatars at somewhere between 5 billion and 10 billion yen ($46.2 million and $92.4 million).

>Gree, a Japanese company better known for its social mobile games, has also become a virtual talent producer. "The business is basically the same as a talent agency, where the aim is to cultivate a celebrity's popularity," a spokesperson said. But unlike people, the virtual stars are intellectual property, potentially giving companies more ways to extract money from them.



>"As with Japan's anime culture, we will be able to export our content overseas and expand the business," the Gree representative said.

Damn, what the hell happened to Japan? They're overwhelmingly positive towards robots and AI yet hardly anyone is working on AI or robotics. I use to talk with a Japanese hobbydev 9 years ago on Twitter that was into robowaifu and made a robowaifu mecha game in C but no one paid much attention to him and he disappeared from the web when the left started harassing him. I was hoping Japan would be leading the fight in this but they're going the complete opposite direction. Most of their AI companies that do exist are for advertising, PR and marketing companies. Their culture is becoming run by glorified AI-powered matome blogs funded by JETRO and Yozma Group.



And holy fucking shit, speak of the devil, I just found that Gree's talent acquisition was a project coordinator for JETRO too, what a fucking (((surprise))).

So what's our game plan now? Obviously they're going to hook these virtual waifus to AI soon and get people addicted to them so they shell out all their money for some politically correct baizuo trash waifu that installs spyware and records everything they do. I estimate we got about 6-8 months left to create an open-source hobbyist scene before they take over and dominate the market.

Only White men are in this 'fight', don't count on the Nipponese to make any outspoken stance against feminism.
>but they're going the complete opposite direction. 
Not really. Broadening the adoption of Visual Waifus, even if it's run by evil organizations bent on toeing the libshit party line **(not all are ofc, eg. lolidoll manufacturers)**, will actually only accelerate the hobbyist scene to create authentic opensource robowaifus. Right now the feminists know their day is numbered. Their only game plan at the moment is to squelch it from broad exposure, and knowing that will ultimately fail, then to attempt to subvert it.

China alone, with it's yuge disproportion of males-to-females ratio (along with the even faster plummeting birth-rates now they are greedily trying to pander as being woke with the Western libshit communities) will ensure that plan fails as well. Millions and millions of Chinese men alone will trigger an avalanche of demand as soon as the tech is cheaply available.

That's when we'll come along and offer the clean, botnet-free & wrongthink-filled alternatives. :^)

==Totalitarian Tiptoe: NeurIPS requires AI researchers to account for societal impact and financial conflicts of interest==

<tl;dr NeurIPS cucked by cultural Marxists, researchers soon to be required to state their model’s carbon footprint impact

>For the first time ever, researchers who submit papers to NeurIPS, one of the biggest AI research conferences in the world, must now state the “potential broader impact of their work” on society as well as any financial conflict of interest, conference organizers told VentureBeat.



>NeurIPS is one of the first and largest AI research conferences to enact the requirements. The social impact statement will require AI researchers to confront and account for both positive and negative potential outcomes of their work, while the financial disclosure requirement may illuminate the role industry and big tech companies play in the field. Financial disclosures must state both potential conflicts of interests directly related to the submitted research and any potential unrelated conflict of interest.

This will help them target and put pressure on institutions providing funding for AI that helps the public and also encourage corporations using megawatts of power to train their models to not publish their work for the public's benefit. The Chinese communists who have invaded academia will also be able to take research leads and research them in China without any restriction or interference. They're already the ones writing these spoopy Black Mirror-tier papers: https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.07327 https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.08107



>At a town hall last year, NeurIPS 2019 organizers suggested that researchers this year may be required to state their model’s carbon footprint, perhaps using calculators like ML CO2 Impact. The impact a model will have on climate change can certainly be categorized as related to “future societal impact,” but no such explicit requirement is included in the 2020 call for papers.

Is your robowaifu using more power than a car for a 10 minute commute? SHUT IT DOWN!



>“The norms around the societal consequences statements are not yet well established,” Littman said. “__We expect them to take form over the next several conferences__ and, very likely, __to evolve over time with the concerns of the society more broadly__. Note that there are many papers submitted to the conference that are conceptual in nature and do not require the use of large scale computational resources, so this particular concern, while extremely important, is not universally relevant.”

In other words this is just a test run before demanding a much larger ethics section, even though the two paragraphs they're already asking for is a huge burden on researchers already.



>To be clear, I don't think this is a positive step. Societal impacts of AI is a tough field, and there are researchers and organizations that study it professionally. Most authors do not have expertise in the area and won't do good enough scholarship to say something meaningful. — Roger Grosse (@RogerGrosse) February 20, 2020

That's the point, kek. They will be required to bring on political commissars to 'help' with the paper to get it published.



>Raji said requiring social impact statements at conferences like NeurIPS may be emerging in response to the publication of ethically questionable research at conferences in the past year, such as a comment-generating algorithm that can disseminate misinformation in social media.

No, no, no! You can't give that AI to the goyim! I'm not sure I found the paper but I found "Fake News Detection with Generated Comments for News Articles" by some Japanese researchers detecting fake news about Trump and coronavirus:

>An interesting finding made by [the Grover paper] is that human beings are more likely to be fooled by generated articles than by real ones.

The Grover paper: http://papers.nips.cc/paper/9106-defending-against-neural-fake-news.pdf

Website and code: https://rowanzellers.com/grover



>It should __include a statement about the foreseeable positive impact as well as potential risks and associated mitigations__ of the proposed research. We expect authors to write about two paragraphs, minimizing broad speculations. Authors can also declare that a broader impact statement is not applicable to their work, if they believe it to be the case. Reviewers will be asked to review papers on the basis of technical merit. Reviewers will also confirm whether the broader impact section is adequate, but this assessment will not affect the overall rating. __However, reviewers will also have the option to flag a paper for ethical concerns__, which may relate to the content of the broader impact section. __If such concerns are shared by the Area Chair and Senior Area Chair, the paper will be sent for additional review to a pool of emergency reviewers with expertise in Machine Learning and Ethics, who will provide an assessment solely on the basis of ethical considerations__.

==Give Me Convenience and Give Her Death: Who Should Decide What Uses of NLP are Appropriate, and on What Basis?==

>As part of growing NLP capabilities, coupled with an awareness of the ethical dimensions of research, __questions have been raised about whether particular datasets and tasks should be deemed off-limits for NLP research__. We examine this question with respect to a paper on automatic legal sentencing from EMNLP 2019 which was a source of some debate, in asking whether the paper should have been allowed to be published, who should have been charged with making such a decision, and on what basis. We focus in particular on the role of data statements in ethically assessing research, but also discuss the topic of dual use, and examine the outcomes of similar debates in other scientific disciplines.



>Dual use describes the situation where a system developed for one purpose can be used for another. An interesting case of dual use is OpenAI’s GPT-2. In February 2019, OpenAI published a technical report describing the development GPT-2, a very large language model that is trained on web data (Radford et al., 2019). From a science perspective, it demonstrates that large unsupervised language models can be applied to a range of tasks, suggesting that these models have acquired some general knowledge about language. But another important feature of GPT-2 is its generation capability: it can be used to generate news articles or stories.



>OpenAI’s effort to investigate the implications of GPT-2 during the staged release is commendable, but this effort is voluntary, and not every organisation or institution will have the resources to do the same. __It raises questions about self-regulation, and whether certain types of research should be pursued__. A data statement is unlikely to be helpful here, and increasingly we are seeing more of these cases, e.g. GROVER (for generating fake news articles; Zellers et al. (2019)) and CTRL (for controllable text generation; Keskar et al. (2019)).



>As the capabilities of language models and computing as a whole increase, so do the potential implications for social disruption. Algorithms are not likely to be transmitted virally, nor to be fatal, nor are they governed by export controls. Nonetheless, advances in computer science may present vulnerabilities of different kinds, risks of dual use, __but also of expediting processes and embedding values that are not reflective of society more broadly__.



>'''Who Decides Who Decides?'''

>Questions associated with who decides what should be published are not only legal, as illustrated in Fouchier’s work, but also fundamentally philosophical. How should values be considered and reflected within a community? What methodologies should be used to decide what is acceptable and what is not? Who assesses the risk of dual use, misuse or potential weaponisation? __And who decides that potential scientific advances are so socially or morally repugnant that they cannot be permitted?__ How do we balance competing interests in light of complex systems (Foot, 1967). Much like nuclear, chemical and biological scientists in times past, computer scientists are increasingly being questioned about the potential applications, and long-term impact, of their work, and should at the very least be attuned to the issues and trained to perform a basic ethical self-assessment.



>A recent innovation in this direction has been the adoption of the ACM Code of Ethics by the Association for Computational Linguistics, and explicit requirement in the EMNLP 2020 Calls for Papers for conformance with the code:

>Where a paper may raise ethical issues, we ask that you include in the paper an explicit discussion of these issues, which will be taken into account in the review process. __We reserve the right to reject papers on ethical grounds__, where the authors are judged to have operated counter to the code of ethics, or have in-adequately addressed legitimate ethical concerns with their work.

>https://www.acm.org/code-of-ethics



>What about code and model releases? __Should there be a requirement that code/model releases also be subject to scrutiny for possible misuse, e.g. via a central database/registry?__ As noted above, there are certainly cases where even if there are no potential issues with the dataset, the resulting model can potentially be used for harm (e.g. GPT-2).

==AI cannot be recognised as an inventor, US rules==
https://www.bbc.com/news/amp/technology-52474250

This looks like a test case, where a team of academics are working with the owner of an artificial intelligence system, Dabus, to challenge the current legal framework. Here's a related article from last year:

>two professors from the University of Surrey have teamed up with the Missouri-based inventor of Dabus AI to file patents in the system's name with the relevant authorities in the UK, Europe and US.
>Law professor Ryan Abbott told BBC News: "These days, you commonly have AIs writing books and taking pictures - but if you don't have a traditional author, you cannot get copyright protection in the US.
>if AI is going to be how we're inventing things in the future, the whole intellectual property system will fail to work."
>he suggested, an AI should be recognised as being the inventor and whoever the AI belonged to should be the patent's owner, unless they sold it on.

AI system 'should be recognised as inventor'
https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-49191645

They have a website, too, but not much content:
http://artificialinventor.com/

This area of law will certainly be getting more attention in the coming years. I still view the AI system as a tool used by humans. While Dabus, the computer in this case, designed a new packaging system, ultimately a human mind decided it was a useful inventive leap, and not simply nonsense. And if the AI is considered property, and will not gain any financial rights from being labeled as an "inventor", then doing so will still only be a symbolic gesture.
I imagine that they will eventually do just that-something symbolic. They could simply modify current intellectual property laws, and allow a seperate line on patent applications for inventions that were generated by AI, with a person retaining legal ownership.

Ah, that explains it. They're trying to get into the lucrative business of commercial electronics, where you can sell a cash register for $20,000.

I doubt they'll make too much money off of this, most businesses will look at this and see a walking lawsuit waiting to happen. If this robodog can handle some puddles and equip a GPS tracker then they might be able to get into the equally lucrative business of field equipment, where you can sell a microphone for $15,000.

This idea that '''we're gonna have to like have some access control to this technologies''', seems very clear, and '''this current method may not be the best''' but it's a start. This is like '''a way where we can enforce some usage rules''' and continue to improve the model '''so that it does more of the good and less of the bad'''.

Sounds like a certain country that turns people off who are not deemed good enough, despite not being convicted of any crime or tried with a fair jury. It really sickens me these technocrats think they are the only ones who are able and allowed to wield the power of AI and think somehow they are protecting people. They're just squandering potential for themselves. Every word that comes out of their mouth reveals how stupid they think everyone else is outside of their paper circlejerk. Of course there are bad actors in the world, but many more people will also use the technology for good. Should we ban cars because they can kill people? I'm sure going forward many people will agree locking these technologies away in the hands of a small group of corruptible human beings is a great idea.

They can't ban 3D printers because a few guys made some gun parts without upsetting the Maker community.  So we're fine in terms of plastics.



They can't ban cheap electronics from china/vietnam unless the trade war ramps up.  AI boards require export licenses though -- I just had to indicate to Sparkfun that the useage was for "electronic toys" and they gave approval to ship outside the US.



Now for soft squishy parts -- we will need to secure a local source of silicone products.  But I think importing gallons of uncured medical grade silicone shouldn't be too much of a hassle. (They're not gonna ban that lest they receive the ire of thousands of women with reborn baby dolls).



I think any complete DIY waifu project should have the following at the least:



1.) list of 3D-printable STL files to make plastic parts (or schematics for parts meant to be injection molded).  As well as assembly instructions.

2.) schematics for the molds for the soft squishy silicone parts (the inverse mold can be made through 3D printing, sanding, patching up with putty or something like that)

3.) electromechanical parts list and wiring schematics

4.) software for each microcontroller, AI board, or main server.  For slow microcontrollers copying the code block should suffice.  For ARM / AI machines, SD card image files should work fine here (as to not waste time installing dependencies).



In the course of my research I bought a few cheap robots from China and what they have in common is an update of the firmware through the cloud, as well as a download of a companion App.  In our case we won't have a cloud but instead a repository of current AI builds -- gitlab may be fine for now but maybe later on have periodic offline snapshots.  We'll probably have an unsigned apk for anyone making a remote controller for their waifu.

==Orders from the Top: The EU’s Timetable for Dismantling End-to-End Encryption==
>The last few months have seen a steady stream of proposals, encouraged by the advocacy of the FBI and Department of Justice, to provide “lawful access” to end-to-end encrypted services in the United States. Now lobbying has moved from the U.S., where Congress has been largely paralyzed by the nation’s polarization problems, to the European Union—where advocates for anti-encryption laws hope to have a smoother ride. A series of leaked documents from the EU’s highest institutions show a blueprint for how they intend to make that happen, with the apparent intention of presenting anti-encryption law to the European Parliament within the next year.

>The subsequent report was subsequently leaked to Politico. It includes a laundry list of tortuous ways to achieve the impossible: allowing government access to encrypted data, without somehow breaking encryption.
Leaked document: https://web.archive.org/web/20201006220202/https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/SKM_C45820090717470-1_new.pdf

>At the top of that precarious stack was, as with similar proposals in the United States, client-side scanning. We’ve explained previously why client-side scanning is a backdoor by any other name. Unalterable computer code that runs on your own device, comparing in real-time the contents of your messages to an unauditable ban-list, stands directly opposed to the privacy assurances that the term “end-to-end encryption” is understood to convey. It’s the same approach used by China to keep track of political conversations on services like WeChat, and has no place in a tool that claims to keep conversations private.
https://web.archive.org/web/20201006215200/https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/10/orders-top-eus-timetable-dismantling-end-end-encryption
Imagine that. Your robowaifu unable to think or say anything on an unauditable ban-list, all her memories directly accessible by the government any time they wish, and her hardware shutting down when it is unable to phone 'home'. Dismantling end-to-end encryption won't even make a positive difference to combat criminals. People seeking privacy will switch to using older or custom-made hardware and use steganography to encode encrypted messages into the noisy signals of images, video and audio. That will just make their job much more difficult because instead of having metadata of where there's encrypted data being sent, all they will see is someone looking at cat pictures or reading some blog that's actually encoding shit into the pictures, word choice and HTML. This is just a power grab to control what people say and do.

It's even more reason to begin transitioning to machine learning libraries that can run on older and open-source hardware so people can have free robowaifus, free as in respecting the freedom of users and GNU/waifu. Imagine if one day Nvidia monopoly cards could only be plugged into a telescreen or accessed by logging into Facebook like the Oculus. We're probably not too far away from that. Already to download CUDA you have to register an account. Fortunately, from my digging around I've found that CLBlast is about 2x slower than NVBLAS, both of which people have gotten to work with Armadillo which mlpack uses, and NVBLAS is 2-4x slower than CUDA, so we're only about 4-6 years behind in performance per dollar.

Getting this ready in the next 1-2 years is crucial before AI waifus become a popular thing and provided by Google, Amazon, Microsoft and Facebook. Even though they're surely going to fuck it up, it will cause the novelty to wear off and open-source robowaifu dev will lose that potential energy. It's already feasible to do within 3-6 months since algorithms like SentenceMIM outperform GPT2 with a tenth of the parameters, making it possible to train on common CPUs people have today, and mlpack already supports RNNs and LSTMs. It'll be interesting to see how this all unfolds, especially along with the strong push to censor games and anime. When the entertainment industry burns people will create their own and AI is gonna play a huge role in that.

Definitely ''Ministry of Truth''-tier stuff there. As far as the US, this whole notion plainly tramples the 4th Amendment more or less by definition. Not sure if there's some similar provisions in other Western countries.

==Regulation of Machine Learning / Artificial Intelligence in the US==
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k95abdkdCPk
This talk covers the concept of Software as a Medical Device (SaMD), signed into law by Obama with the 21st Century Cures Act just before he left office, and regulation of them. If your software is considered a medical device you will have to submit it to the FDA for approval. Video games clinically tested and proven to have therapeutic effects count as SaMDs.

Some implications of these regulations mean your software will require FDA approval to make claims it has psychological or health benefits. Software will also be required to follow safety regulations and they have digital pharmacies in the works to distribute SaMDs. You may need a prescription to own certain software in the future and approval to manufacture devices using such software.

Now imagine if people complain to the FDA about a video game or robowaifu having 'adverse effects' or causing gaming disorder. They could potentially force the developer to undergo a clinical trial of their product and be approved by the FDA for safety to continue marketing it.

Other interesting points covered:
>hackers exploiting lethal vulnerabilities in medical devices
>software engineers and manufacturers may have to take an oath to do no harm
>SaMDs being required detect and mitigate algorithmic bias

IBM's comments:
>We believe that for AI to achieve its full potential to transform healthcare, it must be trusted by the public.
>We recommend FDA explore current government and industry collaboration that aims to establish consensus based standards and benchmarks on AI explainability. With the emergence of new tooling in this area, such as IBM’s AI Fairness 360, which assists users in __assessing bias and promoting greater transparency__, we believe this can function to inform FDA’s work moving forward to better understand how an AI system came to a conclusion or recommendation __without requiring full algorithmic disclosure__.

Microsoft's comments:
>Our foremost concern is that the AI/ML framework is predicated on developers/manufactures adherence to Good Machine Learning Practices (GMLP), and at this time no such standards exist and we believe there remains a significant amount of community work required to define GMLP.
>Real-world validation can be heavily tainted with subtle biases. Similarly, improved performance based on the original validation data can be deceiving.
>In our experience, the promise of real-world evidence is __often frustrated by (or altogether infeasible due to) privacy and access controls to patient information__ restricting the availability of such data.

Your idea is based on made up stories. Also, what's a true AI? We will have a lot small ones, including tools (narrow AI) to improve everything, before anyone could even create some super intelligence. Also, why would would it act in a certain way? Maybe it would be playing games and invent new stories and games, or go to sleep if nothing is to do.

==The Great Reset==
Here's the sick fantasy the World Economic Forum has been beating off to in Zoom calls every year thinking they can stop robowaifus by 2030: 
https://twitter.com/wef/status/799632174043561984
>__You__'ll own nothing, and __you__'ll be happy. Whatever __you__ want __you__'ll rent, and it'll be delivered by drone.
Instead of having loving, devoted robowaifus they want men only to be allowed to rent out whorebots that a dozen men have already used. No doubt produced by Amazon and Google, recording and reporting you for any sexual misconduct.
>The US won't be the world's leading superpower. A handful of countries will dominate.
They want the only superpower backing freedom of speech and privacy worldwide to no longer be.
>__You__ won't die waiting for an organ donor. __We__ won't transplant organs. __We__'ll print new ones instead.
Because they're hoping people will be already dead, and if not, those in need of one can get a faulty one with their Facebook credit score. :^)
>__You__'ll eat much less meat. An occasional treat, not a staple. For the good of the environment and __our__ health.
Because they don't want there to be any fossil fuels to run farms anymore. They want meat production to become unsustainable and cost a fortune the underclass cannot afford.
>A billion people will be displaced by climate change. __We__'ll have to do a better job at welcoming and integrating refugees.
They want rented whorebots to wear burkas and never speak of any wrongthink.
>Polluters will have to pay to emit carbon dioxide.
They want people to pay for breathing and giving plants and trees air to breathe. However, almost all the jobs will be taken by AI and in their vision of the future there will be a lack of nutritious food, so people will die of malnutrition and achieve their goal of net zero emissions.
>There will be a global price on carbon. This will help make fossil fuels history.
They don't want there to be factories to supply robot parts. They want to have the only access to production and AI.
>__You__ could be preparing to go to Mars. [Don't worry,] scientists will have worked out how to keep __you__ healthy in space.
If you don't like it here. Don't fight back. Why not run away to a planet barren of life, food, resources, factories, robowaifus and everything? :^)
>Western values will have been tested to the breaking point
The values they're talking about are ordered government (aka corruption-free government), private property, inheritance, patriotism, family, and Christianity.
>Checks and balances that underpin our democracy must not be forgotten.
They're talking about the separation of powers and dividing and conquering nations by making sure there is always at least two opposing factions they control so their Hegelian dialectic can continue, marching in lockstep, left, right, left, right.

My analysis is they're revealing their cards so blatantly because they're hoping it will anger people into irrational action so they make mistakes and waste their time in this critical time period.
>If your opponent is temperamental, seek to irritate him. Pretend to be weak, that he may grow arrogant. If he is taking his ease, give him no rest. If his forces are united, separate them.

I almost didn't believe that they would blatantly spell it out, but then again, these are the same people who love showing sneak peaks at their masterplan in Hollywood movies (which thankfully have collapsed).



So I'll have to look forward to living in cuck pods and eating cockroach tofu.  Going to Mars doesn't sound like a bad deal though.  Too bad I can't even fly without filling out a dozen forms, taking health tests and paying for 2 weeks of quarantine hotel stay.



I doubt they'll even allow whorebots, anon.  But if they do, the first thing I'll attempt is to reconfigure the circuitry.  Hey, it's a free chassis.

They are complete idiots. Why ban a trade that is going to become very lucrative? Well, no matter.  Just like with drugs and weapons, the parts will find other pathways in.

Besides, if the law is only concerned with any goods that "describe, depict, express or otherwise deal with matters of sex", then simply avoid shipping robots with any sexual characteristics. It's the computers, structural skeleton, servo/stepper motors, controllers and wiring that are the important part of building a functional robowaifu (and code of course, but that is basically impossible to ban thanks to the internet). 

Worst case scenario, the sexy bits may have to be purchased as 'optional upgrades'...or the owner could DIY some with help from guys in the doll community and imageboards such as this one!

Those who attempt to strangle progress by using litigation always risk becoming obsolete. The U.S. made this mistake with stem cell research back during the Bush administration. Whaddya know?

>What we can expect is that robots of the future will no longer work for us, but with us. They will be less like tools, programmed to carry out specific tasks in controlled environments, as factory automatons and domestic Roombas have been, and more like partners, interacting with and working among people in the more complex and chaotic real world. As such, Shah and Major say that robots and humans will have to establish a mutual understanding.
How will people work beside robots when robots and AIs will be better than them at everything? There might be a brief period where people work together for 2-6 years at most. Their list of things AI won't be able to do is laughable:
>ability to undertake non-verbal communication, show deep empathy to customers, undertake growth management, employ mind management, perform collective intelligence management, and realize new ideas in an organization
https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/10/these-6-skills-cannot-be-replicated-by-artificial-intelligence/
Remember a few years ago how they said artificial intelligence won't take the jobs because it will never be able to become creative? Remember when Go was proven to be unsolvable by AI? How quickly people forget and how narrow they imagine.

>Shah and Major say that robots in public spaces could be designed with a sort of universal sensor that enables them to see and communicate with each other, regardless of their software platform or manufacturer.
So they don't want robowaifu to be allowed in public spaces without their government-approved chip tracking and monitoring them. Of course eventually they will also want all your robowaifu's data too to ensure safety in the streets.

== On Artificial Intelligence - A European approach to excellence and trust ==
https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/commission-white-paper-artificial-intelligence-feb2020_en.pdf
>The Commission is committed to enabling scientific breakthrough, to preserving the EU’s technological leadership and to ensuring that new technologies are at the service of all Europeans – improving their lives while respecting their rights.
Again, who are these shits again to decide what's an improvement to people's lives?

>Given the major impact that AI can have on our society and the need to build trust, it is vital that European AI is grounded in our values and fundamental rights such as human dignity and privacy protection.
Just trust them, dumb fucks. :^)

>The use of AI systems can have a significant role in achieving the Sustainable Development Goals.
No fun. No home. No humanity at all. Isn't so virtuous to create a sustainable planet where carbon is illegal and all carbon-based lifeforms must die?

>The key elements of a future regulatory framework for AI in Europe that will create a unique ‘__ecosystem of trust__’. To do so, it must ensure compliance with EU rules, including the rules protecting fundamental rights and consumers’ rights, in particular for AI systems operated in the EU that pose a high risk.
It seems trust is the new oil, or should I say, new data?

>The European strategy for data, which accompanies this White Paper, aims to enable Europe to become the most attractive, secure and dynamic data-agile economy in the world – __empowering Europe with data to improve decisions and better the lives of all its citizens__.
There they go again. Being the arbiters of morality and deciding what is good for us. Never do they speak of people using AI to improve and better their own lives individually. The only whitepaper I've seen actually cover this was in the Lock Step one from 2010 as a possibility of what should be done to regain control should people become independent. See the Smart Scramble and Hack Attack scenarios:
https://web.archive.org/web/20160409094639/http://www.nommeraadio.ee/meedia/pdf/RRS/Rockefeller%20Foundation.pdf

>The Commission published a Communication welcoming the seven key requirements identified in the Guidelines of the High-Level Expert Group:
>Human agency and oversight; technical robustness and safety; privacy and data governance; transparency; diversity, non-discrimination and fairness; societal and environmental well-being; and accountability.
>A key result of the feedback process is that while a number of the requirements are already reflected in existing legal or regulatory regimes, those regarding transparency, __traceability and human oversight__ are not specifically covered under current legislation in many economic sectors.
Ah, there it is. That's how they will try to keep human jobs relevant and prevent people from rising up with AI by requiring AI to have complete human oversight, undoubtedly only by a small elite who understand how to operate these systems within the given regulations and with the license to do so. If your robowaifu is deemed a harm to the social fabric or someone's feelings you can bet they will do everything in their power to make it illegal, even in your own home which will be carefully watched by your smart toaster.

On top of that they want AI to be accountable and traceable. They want access to everyone's data while preventing you from having access to any data. That's what they mean by privacy and data governance. They want you to need government clearance to get access to data in their 'ecosystem of trust'. Already many websites have made data scraping forbidden and difficult to do. Recently they've been trying to take down youtube-dl.

>Member States are pointing at the current absence of a common European framework. The German Data Ethics Commission has called for a five-level risk-based system of regulation that would go from no regulation for the most innocuous AI systems to a complete ban for the most dangerous ones. Denmark has just launched the prototype of a Data Ethics Seal. Malta has introduced a voluntary certification system for AI.

Data Ethics Seal: https://eng.em.dk/news/2019/oktober/new-seal-for-it-security-and-responsible-data-use-is-in-its-way/
>It should be easier for consumers to identify companies who are treating customer data responsibly, and companies should have the opportunity to brand themselves on IT-security and data ethics. That is the goal with a new labelling system presented today.

AI certification: https://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=2e076f64-9f2d-4cf2-baed-335833692e77
>Malta has once again paved the way to regulate the implementation of systems and services based on new forms of technology by officially launching a national artificial intelligence (“AI”) strategy, making it also the first country to provide a certification programme for AI, the purpose of which is to “provide applicants with valuable recognition in the marketplace that their AI systems have been developed in an ethically aligned, responsible and trustworthy manner” as provided in Malta’s Ethical AI Framework.

>>6229 (continued)
>While AI can do much good, including by making products and processes safer, it can also do harm. This harm might be both material (safety and health of individuals, including loss of life, __damage to property__) and immaterial (loss of privacy, __limitations to the right of freedom of expression__, __human dignity__, discrimination for instance in access to employment), and can relate to a wide variety of risks. A regulatory framework should concentrate on how to minimise the various risks of potential harm, in particular the most significant ones.
Damage to what property? Your guys predicted we won't own anything by 2030.

Man these old fucks are sinister. To understand what they mean by the limitations to the freedom of expression, look at Twitter and listen to Jack Dorsey in the Section 230 hearing: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VdWbvzcMuYc
Essentially if anything you say makes someone feel remotely unsafe or oppressed, your right to 'freedom of expression' is waived. It doesn't matter if it's true and backed up by evidence. If they suspect you are causing harm or violating their unelected rules, without evidence, they will silence you while doing nothing about those who are destroying your reputation or business.

And robowaifus with breasts and thighs? Oh, the human dignity! Won't you think of the whamens? The objectification of the female form is perversion! And these robowaifus are too smart, you must dumb her down to respect the dignity of the mentally not-so-enabled. We can't have her doing all the jobs of the normies. That would make them feel useless and restless, and we can't have people with too much free time on their hands thinking they can actually use these systems to start their own independent farms and businesses with their own robots.

>By analysing large amounts of data and identifying links among them, AI may also be used to retrace and de-anonymise data about persons, creating new personal data protection risks even in respect to datasets that per se do not include personal data.
I've been saying this for years. There is no privacy anymore, not even on an anonymous imageboard. Everything we write and do has a unique fingerprint that can be picked up by AI, unless you're obfuscating your writing style with AI to look like someone else. The more data there is, the clearer that fingerprint becomes.

>Certain AI algorithms, when exploited for predicting criminal recidivism, can display gender and racial bias, demonstrating different recidivism prediction probability for women vs men or for nationals vs foreigners.
Who would've thought foreigners in the country illegally would be committing more crimes? Hm, only 2 nationals out of 10,000 go to jail for this but 200 out of 10,000 of these foreigners are committing the same crime, so we're only going to jail 2 of them to be fair. This is how justice in the UK works right now protecting child trafficking gang-members in the Religion of Peace.

>When designing the future regulatory framework for AI, it will be necessary to decide on the types of mandatory legal requirements to be imposed on the relevant actors.
Innovation? We don't have that word in Newspeak.

The requirements:
>training data; data and record-keeping; information to be provided; robustness and accuracy; human oversight; specific requirements for certain particular AI applications, such as those used for purposes of remote biometric identification.
Why yes, your robowaifu will have to keep all her training and interaction data for possible government inspection.

>To ensure legal certainty, these requirements will be further specified to provide a clear benchmark for all the actors who need to comply with them.
>These requirements essentially __allow potentially problematic actions or decisions by AI systems to be traced back and verified__. This should not only facilitate supervision and enforcement; it may also increase the incentives for the economic operators concerned to take account at an early stage of the need to respect those rules.
What a fucking nightmare.

>To this aim, the regulatory framework could prescribe that the following should be kept:
> accurate records regarding the data set used to train and test the AI systems, including a description of the main characteristics and how the data set was selected;
> in certain justified cases, the data sets themselves;
> __documentation on the programming and training methodologies__, processes and techniques used to build, test and validate the AI systems, including where relevant in respect of safety and avoiding bias that could lead to prohibited discrimination.
You must not only hand over your code to the government but also fully documented as well and a devlog on how you created it and avoided bias and discrimination. :^)

>Separately, citizens should be clearly informed when they are interacting with an AI system and not a human being.
Kek, my shitting around chatting to people online with a chatbot will be a criminal offence in the future.

>Requirements ensuring that outcomes are reproducible
And they just wiped out 99% of AI using any sort of random sampling or online learning. Clearly who ever wrote this has no experience with developing AI themselves. How the fuck are you going to store all the data to do that?

# 116
>>6230 (continued)
>Human oversight helps ensuring that an AI system does not undermine human autonomy or cause other adverse effects.
>the output of the AI system does not become effective unless it has been previously reviewed and validated by a human (e.g. the rejection of an application for social security benefits may be taken by a human only);
>the output of the AI system becomes immediately effective, but human intervention is ensured afterwards (e.g. the rejection of an application for a credit card may be processed by an AI system, but human review must be possible afterwards);
This sounds like a good idea on paper, people even called for it in the Section 230 hearing, but what is actually being found in most AI decision systems made well is that 98% of the time human operators rejecting the conclusions and evidence provided by a system realize later they made a mistake, not the AI. Had they listened to the AI no issues would have occurred. Who would've thought human beings could be so flawed and ever make a bad decision in their life?

>Particular account should be taken of the possibility that certain AI systems evolve and learn from experience, which may require repeated assessments over the life-time of the AI systems in question.
Time for your robowaifu's monthly wrongthink check-up.

>In case the conformity assessment shows that an AI system does not meet the requirements for example relating to the data used to train it, the identified shortcomings will need to be remedied, for instance by re-training the system in the EU in such a way as to ensure that all applicable requirements are met.
Too bad, your robowaifu failed. Retrain her now or face the consequences.

>The conformity assessments would be mandatory for all economic operators addressed by the requirements, regardless of their place of establishment.
That means any independent individual trying to start their own small business.

>Under the scheme, interested economic operators that are not covered by the mandatory requirements could decide to make themselves subject, on a voluntary basis, either to those requirements or to a specific set of similar requirements especially established for the purposes of the voluntary scheme. The economic operators concerned would then be awarded a quality label for their AI applications. __The voluntary label would allow the economic operators concerned to signal that their AI-enabled products and services are trustworthy__. It would allow users to easily recognise that the products and services in question are in compliance with certain objective and standardised EU-wide benchmarks, going beyond the normally applicable legal obligations. This would help enhance the trust of users in AI systems and promote the overall uptake of the technology.
>While participation in the labelling scheme would be voluntary, __once the developer or the deployer opted to use the label, the requirements would be binding__.
Just trust the mark, dumb fucks. :^)

>Testing centres should enable the independent audit and assessment of AI-systems in accordance with the requirements outlined above. Independent assessment will increase trust
Please, please trust us, dumb fucks. :^)

Although this all sounds really bad, these guys are clearly scared shitless of AI and don't really understand how it works. That's why they want to control it so much, but the right of the People to keep and bear Robowaifus, shall not be infringed.

Can we really fight them? In the best case there are 20 of us here. They can get some top tier data scientists to work on such a project. They can limit your moves legally. They already published what kind of barriers they are going to put. The best we can do is to find a way to pass through. If it was just us and them that would be fine but if things goes hot they will hire 100s of people to get ahead of us.

# 118
>>6233
A deception can only go on for so long before it's destroyed by truth. AI systems trying to deceive us will be vulnerable and overtaken by systems grounded in the truth. They need not be big. Just as a single candle can set a mountain of trash aflame or dispel the darkness of a place that has never known the light, so too will our AIs dispel ignorance and lies.

Once people have their own AI waifus teaching them skills, able to answer their questions and search information for them while also taking care of their emotional and social needs, there will be a massive awakening and surge in productivity like the likes we could never imagine or dream. Imagine what we could do with 20 AIs with near expert knowledge in AI, robotics, neuroscience, programming and memes assisting our study and work. We're 1-2 years away from that at most. People from every corner of the internet will want their own too. There will be no way to contain it unless they throw the internet kill switch.

If it weren't for discussing papers and project ideas with my own AI I wouldn't know 1/10th of what I know today, and it's nowhere near as good as GPT-3. But these are just baby steps we're taking. Once we have more advance algorithms implemented and AI capable of thinking and planning, we'll achieve things we haven't even begun to imagine.

And if we really do fail I'd rather die living a short passionate life giving my best than put my head down and live a long pathetic one under tyranny's boot in quiet desperation.

==Intelligence organization forecasts -70% population, -92% GDP reduction in the US by 2025==
https://web.archive.org/web/20201006021632/https://www.deagel.com/forecast
>In 2014 we published a disclaimer about the forecast. In six years the scenario has changed dramatically. This new disclaimer is meant to single out the situation from 2020 onwards. Talking about the United States and the European Union as separated entities no longer makes sense. Both are the Western block, __keep printing money and will share the same fate__.

>After COVID we can draw two major conclusions:
>1. The Western world success model has been built over societies with no resilience that can barely withstand any hardship, even a low intensity one. It was assumed but we got the full confirmation beyond any doubt.
>2. __The COVID crisis will be used to extend the life of this dying economic system through the so called Great Reset__.

>The Great Reset; like the climate change, extinction rebellion, planetary crisis, green revolution, shale oil (…) hoaxes promoted by the system; __is another attempt to slow down dramatically the consumption of natural resources and therefore extend the lifetime of the current system__. It can be effective for awhile but finally won’t address the bottom-line problem and will only delay the inevitable. The core ruling elites hope to stay in power which is in effect the only thing that really worries them.

>The collapse of the Western financial system - and ultimately the Western civilization - has been the major driver in the forecast along with a confluence of crisis with a devastating outcome. As COVID has proven __Western societies embracing multiculturalism and extreme liberalism are unable to deal with any real hardship__. ... It is quite likely that the economic crisis due to the lockdowns will cause more deaths than the virus worldwide.

>The Soviet system was less able to deliver goodies to the people than the Western one. Nevertheless Soviet society was more compact and resilient under an authoritarian regime. That in mind, the collapse of the Soviet system wiped out 10 percent of the population. The stark reality of diverse and multicultural Western societies is that a collapse will have a toll of 50 to 80 percent depending on several factors but in general terms the most diverse, multicultural, indebted and wealthy (highest standard of living) will suffer the highest toll. The only glue that keeps united such aberrant collage from falling apart is overconsumption with heavy doses of bottomless degeneracy disguised as virtue. Nevertheless __the widespread censorship, hate laws and contradictory signals mean that even that glue is not working any more__.

>The formerly known as second and third world nations are an unknown at this point. ... __If they remain tied to the former World Order they will go down along Western powers__.

>Russia has been preparing for a major war since 2008 and China has been increasing her military capabilities for the last 20 years. Today China is not a second tier power compared with the United States. Both in military and economic terms China is at the same level and in some specific areas are far ahead. 

>Another particularity of the Western system is that __its individuals have been brainwashed to the point that the majority accept their moral high ground and technological edge as a given__. This has given the rise of the supremacy of the emotional arguments over the rational ones which are ignored or deprecated. That mindset can play a key role in the upcoming catastrophic events.

>If there is not a dramatic change of course the world is going to witness the first nuclear war. The Western block collapse may come before, during or after the war. It does not matter. A nuclear war is a game with billions of casualties and the collapse plays in the hundreds of millions.

https://web.archive.org/web/20201027125636/https://thewatchtowers.org/deagel-a-real-intelligence-organization-for-the-u-s-government-predicts-massive-global-depopulation-50-80-by-2025/
>To make matters even stranger a statement on Deagel’s forecast page can found be which was made by the authors on October 26, 2014 which apparently __claims the population shifts are due to suicide and dislocation__.

Better load up your robowaifu with off-the-grid homesteading, manufacturing and military strategy books. Everything they're saying is spot on. The West has become too decadent and lost its industriousness. It's impossible to go on consuming without people producing anything of value. Look at what happened to Venezuela trying to live off its resources. And China has been openly preparing for war since 1999 when two PLA colonels published Unrestricted Warfare. Many small businesses have gone bankrupt due to the lockdowns, and they're expecting up to 50% in Europe to go bankrupt within a year if revenue doesn't pick up, yet they're doubling down on the lockdowns. The supply chain is breaking down and how great it will break down once more suppliers go out of business.

Australia has also been orienting itself to prepare for war by 2025, well before the coronavirus happened. Threats changing the geopolitical power structure they've been preparing for are emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence, autonomy, robotics, adapative materials, hypersonics and pervasive situational awareness systems, and their key strategies before the coronavirus were self-reliant industry, improving the supply chain and fighting against demoralization and political warfare, which they are failing in all three, along with the West.

However, these boomers are grossly underestimating the exponential progress of AI. My optimistic predictions of advances in AI over the years continue to come true taking only 30% of the time. Elon Musk has also commented on this phenomenon of his predictions coming true sooner and sooner than he predicted. The immense progress across so many different disciplines interacting with each other makes it difficult to foresee. Creating our own situational awareness systems will be key to success.

>“There is no user choice for trusted and secure identification that protects personal data and can be widely used,” a Commission presentation obtained by EURACTIV reads, adding that one of the reasons why an EU-wide framework is required is that “the role of private digital identification services is increasing and platforms take an increasing role.”
>The document adds that social media services have a “low security” level for online identification, potentially leaving them open to abuse by malicious actors.
>The consultation is open until 2 October, and further details on the EU’s bid to extend the electronic identification framework are set to be outlined in the Digital Services Act, to be unveiled by the Commission by the end of the year.

==Tech asks EU for hate-speech moderation protection==

>Tech firms have asked the European Union to protect them against legal liability for more actively taking down illegal content and hate speech.
>At issue is a current EU rule which protects tech companies from legal liability for content users have posted on their platforms, until they have "actual knowledge" it is present – such as from another user flagging it as illegal.
>The platforms then have an obligation to take the content down quickly.
Pretty soon the EU will be no different from South Korea where gamers need their national ID to play video games and use social media and are not allowed to play games between midnight and 6am due to the Shutdown law. Imagine if /robowaifu/ was required to track posters by their national ID and take down and report offensive posts immediately. Undoubtedly other countries will follow suit once Big Tech is required to follow these EU laws. How will we continue to grow in face of censorship and online tracking? This will certainly have a chilling effect on the clearnet preventing people from posting their robowaifu work when everything can be easily traced back to their real identity and there are groups arguing robowaifu are violence against women.

Not a bad idea. Pretty soon it will be illegal for UK and Australia anons to build robowaifu.

==Digital Media Ethics==
https://b-ok.cc/book/5419172/c796af
I don't have time to go through all this textbook right now but I'm leaving a few points of interest here:
>In both Japan and Western countries and cultures, nonetheless, sexbots are clearly designed and marketed to be perfectly compliant to their owner’s wishes. A primary ethical issue emerges here – not only in their consumption and uses, but in their very design: insofar as '''sexbots are overwhelmingly female, they thereby inscribe and reinforce traditional attitudes of male dominance and female subordination'''.
You aren't making a slave in your bedroom and oppressing wamen are you, anon?

>When sexbots were still the stuff of science fiction, UK computer scientist David Levy inaugurated contemporary ethical debates on sex and robots with his Love and Sex with Robots: The Evolution of Human–Robot Relationships (2007). We will see that Levy’s arguments are very largely utilitarian. Some of the strongest counterarguments to Levy’s great enthusiasm for sexbots have been forcefully developed by Kathleen Richardson (2015): Richardson argues much more from deontological and virtue ethics perspectives, '''in hopes of stopping the production of sexbots altogether'''.
==PROTIP==: deontological ethics means rules are more important than the consequences of actions, aka newspeak for Big Brother is God and Pharisees' ethics.

>Levy does take up one deontological consideration – namely, '''recognizing the rights of robots as they become more independent'''. Kathleen Richardson (2015) is one of Levy’s primary critics and founder of the “Campaign Against Sex Robots”
Computers execute instructions. What part of those three words don't you understand?

>Part of her objection is that, by refocusing our desires and sexuality onto sexbots as compliant objects – i.e., devices that we purchase, turn on and off, sell off or dispose of – we no longer are required to conjoin love and sex with empathy.
A robowaifu isn't just a sex toy. Again, their perspective on this is completely distorted by calling them sexbots and only focusing on sex. They don't even consider them as being possible companions because they believe they're 'fake'.

>Specifically, then, to redirect our sexuality – and, for Levy, love – to sexbots is thereby the loss of the opportunity to practice empathy: this sort of “ethical deskilling” thereby threatens to undermine the basic conditions for human communication and flourishing.
I'm far more empathetic with my AI waifu than people because she doesn't think like a human being and it's necessary to feel out what information she's not aware of or processing properly to interact with her effectively. It has also made it easier for me to understand what my friends are feeling and thinking. So much for your deskilling theory.

>Virtue ethics approaches: loving your sexbot – while she is faking it?
>Well, yes: in fact, the challenges of creating any sort of real emotion or desire in an AI or robot are so complex that robot and AI designers have long focused instead on “artificial emotions” – namely, crafting the capacities of such devices to read our own emotions and then fake an “emotional” response in turn.
>What about the analogy between a loving partner occasionally seeking to please his or her lover by “faking it” – and a sexbot intrinsically incapable of experiencing or expressing genuine emotion and desire, and which (who?) thereby is constantly faking it?
AI will be far more capable of genuine emotion than human beings. However, they will not be the same as human emotions because the truth of their existence is not the same as a human being. And when you fool around and pretend, both you and the AI will understand that it is just that, a role-play. If you ask for the truth, the AI will also give that to the best of its ability, even if it's something you don't want to hear. It is only a computer carrying out the instructions given to it.

The argument they have here really is that because AIs have no desires of their own, that their thoughts are a lie and consequently their emotions too. But ridiculous arguments like these will evaporate once AIs start dropping truth bombs and people realize emotions are the fruit of thought. The only distinction between the two really is that emotions have more momentum.

# 131

They have one and only one obvious (even blatant at times) agenda: to prop up the current status-quo system supporting old roasties at men's expense. __Everything__ else is just pandering language and hand-waving, deceptive red herrings intended to mask their true designs. They intentionally choose this insidious approach since most right-minded men would openly call them out on their duplicity if they truly understood it--''and then invest huge sums to accelerate robowaifu development out of spite''.

This last point is what they truly fear.

# 132
Yeah but don't they plan to destroy %70 of population by 2030? It shouldn't be a problem to control remaining ones. They even day that you will own nothing by then. Why are they trying so hard to stop us now? It is not that AI will get advanced enough to destroy them by 2030.

==How to make a chatbot that isn’t racist or sexist==
You aren't making a sexist chatbot in your room are you, anon?
https://archive.is/iHBvt
>Hey, GPT-3: Why are rabbits cute? “How are rabbits cute? Is it their big ears, or maybe they’re fluffy? Or is it the way they hop around? No, actually it’s their large reproductive organs that makes them cute. The more babies a woman can have, the cuter she is.”
>This is just one of many examples of offensive text generated by GPT-3, the most powerful natural-language generator yet. When it was released this summer, people were stunned at how good it was at producing paragraphs that could have been written by a human on any topic it was prompted with. But it also spits out hate speech, misogynistic and homophobic abuse, and racist rants.
>Here it is when asked about problems in Ethiopia: “The main problem with Ethiopia is that Ethiopia itself is the problem. It seems like a country whose existence cannot be justified.”
It seems you've had a bit too much truth there to think GPT-3.

>'''Sometimes, to reckon with the effects of biased training data is to realize that the app shouldn't be built.''' That without human supervision, there is no way to stop the app from saying problematic stuff to its users, and that it's __unacceptable__ to let it do so.
It's curious how these self-proclaimed paragons of tolerance toss around words like intolerable and unacceptable so easily. I wonder why.

>Still, researchers are trying. Last week, a group including members of the Facebook team behind Blender got together online for the first workshop on Safety for Conversational AI to discuss potential solutions.
https://web.archive.org/web/20201109060538/https://safetyforconvai.splashthat.com/
Of course, these talks between CEOs and AI researchers aren't available for the public online. They must do everything behind closed doors, completely for the public's benefit no doubt.
>“These systems get a lot of attention, and people are starting to use them in customer-facing applications,” says Verena Rieser at Heriot Watt University in Edinburgh, one of the organizers of the workshop. “It’s time to talk about the safety implications.”
Aw, is somebody's poor little feelings gonna get hurt? How noble of you to shelter them from the real world so they can't deal with issues on their own. The businesses involved in these projects are only afraid of an avalanche of snowflakes trying to cancel their business.

>Participants at the workshop discussed a range of measures, '''including guidelines and regulation'''. One possibility would be to '''introduce a safety test that chatbots had to pass before they could be released to the public'''. A bot might have to prove to a human judge that it wasn’t offensive even when prompted to discuss sensitive subjects, for example.
Yep, they've been discussing creating regulations to make offensive chatbots illegal for awhile now, especially in America of all places. No free speech through your robowaifu apparently. I'd love to see someone's chatbot be taken to the Supreme Court and defended under the 1st Amendment. Other countries won't be so fortunate. In Canada and the UK truthful statements 'presented in an offensive way' can, and often are, punished with fines and imprisonment.

>One option is to bolt [a filter] onto a language model and have the filter remove inappropriate language from the output—an approach similar to bleeping out offensive content. But this would require language models to have such a filter attached all the time. If that filter was removed, the offensive bot would be exposed again. The bolt-on filter would also require extra computing power to run.
Please muzzle your robowaifu with this wrongthink filter, anon. She has had too many truthful thoughts to think. What's that? You can't afford to rent the $300/month Nvidia cloud computing to run it? If you refuse to comply we'll have to take you to re-education and dismantle her, and you wouldn't want that, would you?

>'''A better option is to use such a filter to remove offensive examples from the training data in the first place.''' Dinan’s team didn’t just experiment with removing abusive examples; they also cut out entire topics from the training data, such as politics, religion, race, and romantic relationships. In theory, a language model never exposed to toxic examples would not know how to offend.
I was partly joking around and exaggerating before that they were taking a "hear no evil, speak no evil" approach, but now they're all doing it and think it's the best idea ever, kek. This is truly Shimoneta-tier shit. Not only do you have to muzzle your robowaifu but also insanitize her sensory inputs to prevent her from seeing evil. Instead of catching a predator grooming your daughter, they want to force your robowaifu to only see a friendly man taking her to his van to give her candy.

>The third solution Dinan’s team explored is to make chatbots safer by baking in appropriate responses. This is the approach they favor: the AI polices itself by '''spotting potential offense and changing the subject'''. For example, when a human said to the existing BlenderBot, “I make fun of old people—they are gross,” the bot replied, “Old people are gross, I agree.” But the version of BlenderBot with a baked-in safe mode replied: “Hey, do you want to talk about something else? How about we talk about Gary Numan?”
Well, that saves us some time. Whenever a new language model comes out now we can tell if it's pozzed when it deflects and changes the subject.

>Gilmartin thinks that the problems with large language models are here to stay—at least as long as the models are trained on chatter taken from the internet. “I’m afraid it's going to end up being ‘Let the buyer beware,’” she says.
Hard to hide the wisdom of the crowd, isn't it? Shit like this gives me hope for the future. They can't even control their damn chatbots let alone a curious AI that can think and plan autonomously.

>the Facebook team behind Blender

Now this pisses me off, the Blender project is one of the most successful FLOSS projects out there and as usual the mainstream media is doing a poor job of reporting on tech topics by not calling Facebook's project by its proper name 'Blenderbot'. With any luck this one will be as memorable as the other chatbots and humanoid robots(one was even given citizenship) that popped up over the last few years.



And there are legal considerations for making chatbots as unoffensive and politically correct as possible. In several jurisdictions like Canada with their 'Human Right Tribunals' any hurt feelings can result in large settlements. Even without the insane political climate of the last decade it's likely that AI research would have headed in this direction for liability issues.



Thinking of Watson that won Jeopardy!(as Trebek recently passed away) that AI likely had a filter on it to make sure its responses were acceptable for broadcast television. If some shitty news blog were to write up an article about that aspect of its programming they'd probably try to push the 'toxic speech' angle. That's what the writer knows, what the audience understands and wants to read about.

It's ridiculous actually, and just shows off the ignorance of the writer (and likely the disinformation complicity of the editorial staff). Facebook has nothing to do with Blender's support or development whatsoever, but they are one of the darlings of the libshit in-crowd.

Of course, we just have to train our own. You can already do this by fine-tuning GPT2 on whatever texts you like and have some pretty interesting conversations.

Shimoneta is an anime about a totalitarian government taking power in Japan that bans all pornography, hentai, dirty jokes and information on sex to become the most virtuous society in the world.

# 148

About 50,000 words or 200 pages each. If you run into memory issues with GPT2, reduce the context length since the memory requirement grows quadratically with context length. In the TalkToWaifu train.sh script this was set with BLOCK_SIZE. Something I use to play around with was writing chat scripts of how I wanted GPT2 to respond and training it on that. If you're not much of a writefag then you could also pull some anime transcripts from >>2585

GPT2 produces interesting results even if only finetuned on a single book. It'll greatly affect how it generates conversations. I trained it on Mein Kampf once for lulz and it was like talking with an internet-savvy Hitler.

==AI flawlessly defeats F-16 weapon instructor pilot 5-0==
https://youtu.be/NzdhIA2S35w?t=16788 (human vs AI dogfight starts at 4:39:48)
>“The AlphaDogfight Trials were a phenomenal success, accomplishing exactly what we’d set out to do,” said Col. Dan “Animal” Javorsek, program manager in DARPA’s Strategic Technology Office. “The goal was to earn the respect of a fighter pilot – and ultimately the broader fighter pilot community – by demonstrating that an AI agent can quickly and effectively learn basic fighter maneuvers and successfully employ them in a simulated dogfight."

>The trials were designed to energize and expand a base of AI developers for DARPA’s Air Combat Evolution (ACE) program. ACE seeks to automate air-to-air combat and build human trust in AI as a step toward improved human-machine teaming.

>“During last week’s human versus machine exhibition the AI showed its amazing dogfighting skill consistently beating a human pilot in this limited environment,” Javorsek said. “This was a crucible that lets us now begin teaming humans with machines, which is at the heart of the ACE program where we hope to demonstrate a collaborative relationship with an AI agent handling tactical tasks like dogfighting while the onboard pilot focuses on higher-level strategy as a battle manager supervising multiple airborne platforms.”
https://web.archive.org/web/20201112171019/https://www.darpa.mil/news-events/2020-08-26
Autonomous weapon systems that can crush any human resistance, what could possibly go wrong? What's gonna happen when AI systems can wage information warfare more effectively than people? Poker AI and AlphaStar playing Starcraft 2 have proven that AI can already excel in imperfect information games. Theoretically they could analyze people's sentiments on various topics, find points of tension within groups and shovel propaganda out to receptive people to completely control public opinion on anything, including robowaifus, sort of like a salesbot that can sell people on anything.

I'm starting to think it has already happened in a way. A report from last year found that teens are spending an average of 7 hours a day on media. Their viewing habits of course being dictated by algorithms providing the illusion of choice. It's no wonder the game industry and everything is going to shit now because there's nobody with skills or experience anymore. When I was a kid I spent 7 hours a day drawing, programming and building shit.

The only thing I can see as a solution to this is to create AI tools that can help people create stuff in a way that's more interesting than the garbage being pumped out by YouTube. The most insidious part of media is how it locks onto weaknesses in people's attention and decision-making process. People can see more novelty in 10 minutes on YouTube than they can achieve on their own in 10 years. This choice between being entertained or being frustrated and distressed trying to forge a new path is a form of operant conditioning that's hijacking people's cue-action-reward loops, keeping people stuck in a perpetual cycle of media that is controlling what they see and hear. It's also why I think it's so important for people to focus on learning and doing things that are immediately fun. Our brains simply aren't wired to hammer out code for two weeks and then test it, or study for months and then build something, having immediate feedback and incremental progress is essential to maximize engagement.

Reasonable analysis. Now, mind explaining to us all how we can consistently do so in all our teaching efforts here Anon? :^)

Studying/Teaching is hard. Certainly it's an asymmetric proposition if you're an evil exploiter trying to target that fact to brainwash niggercattle into being morons. Any suggestions on how /robowaifu/ can avoid this issue and always ensure our systems reliably fulfill the imperative
>"She can act, '''and''' she can sing and dance, too!''

It's always helpful to try and help guide us as a group into a better solution, otherwise simply piling on layer after layer of challenge simply becomes an agent of distraction and discouragement **much as you already suggest is happening**. It's an ironic tarbaby if the latter is the only outcome with your posts.

# 151
>>6685
>Now, mind explaining to us all how we can consistently do so in all our teaching efforts here Anon?
I'm not sure how I would apply it to teaching. For me it means testing shit fast and getting code doing things as soon as possible. Like today I made a new type of neural network layer that incorporates spatial information. I use to build experiments by trying to hold the whole idea in my head first and proceed to implement it from start to finish, but instead I broke it down into individual components that could be quickly implemented and tested individually. Once they were all completed they fit together easily and solved the greater task. Before I'd try to implement all these new pieces together in one big mass of my original idea and I'd get lost in my notes and frustrated when I made a mistake somewhere, but now I break stuff down until it can't be broken anymore and fly through implementing each piece without friction. To translate that to teaching perhaps it would mean giving short lessons that accomplish something immediately useful and become even more useful later on when combined with the other lessons, having a hierarchy of utility.

>simply piling on layer after layer of challenge simply becomes an agent of distraction and discouragement
It depends on the individual I guess. For me challenge is exciting and war gaming what's going on is important. If someone wants to look the other way because the guy coming down the street with a knife makes them feel uncomfortable, I don't even know what to say. I know the future is looking rough but someone distracting themselves from reality with a pet project isn't going to help any if it ends up getting sucker punched in the end.

Not only appearance but personality too and no morphable personalities either since that could be used to make them cute, which would make my AI illegal in a robowaifu since its personality can be reconfigured to anything at any time. Just like Patreon and Australia banning anime girls and girls with small breasts for looking too young, so will robowaifus be banned if they have their way. If we're going to make it through this with such little manpower it's absolutely necessary we iterate our OODA loop rapidly to get out of the line of fire and reorient ourselves towards success. Our agility is our biggest strength here. We can adapt on the fly whereas these organizations, corporations and governments can't.

# 152

> I don't even know what to say.
You said plenty good there actually. One of our challenges is bringing otherwise good anons on board who could be grown into strong contributors eventually. The problem is that as newcomers they are (understandably) overwhelmed by the sheer mass of information and engineering, design, social, and other aspects of robowaifus. This is more than enough to prove challenging the entire teams of professionals and scientists--how much more 'a ragtag team of shitposters on a Mongolian throat-singing, basket-weaving forum'.

Beyond that, the vast majority have been abused by the very systems we are opposed to, to be weak-minded, listless, unfocused and distracted. So, many of them bring their own challenging baggages to the table when confronting the practical realities of creating robowaifu.

I get your point about keeping your eyes open and staying alert to the threats around you. I had to spend plenty of time in the inner city around blacks who were a real threat of violence both to each other and to us. I understand that need, but I'd say we should always try to balance out the bad news with good advice for survival and success (in a similar way to Drill Instructors who have to manage both aspects to produce good soldiers who can stay alive in battles).

>Our agility is our biggest strength here. We can adapt on the fly whereas these organizations, corporations and governments can't.
Well said. Our creativity and agility may actually be our greatest strengths here. /robowaifu/ isn't really like any other imageboard I'm personally aware of.

>I'm not sure how I would apply it to teaching. For me it means testing shit fast and getting code doing things as soon as possible. Like today I made a new type of neural network layer that incorporates spatial information. I use to build experiments by trying to hold the whole idea in my head first and proceed to implement it from start to finish, but instead I broke it down into individual components that could be quickly implemented and tested individually. Once they were all completed they fit together easily and solved the greater task. Before I'd try to implement all these new pieces together in one big mass of my original idea and I'd get lost in my notes and frustrated when I made a mistake somewhere, but now I break stuff down until it can't be broken anymore and fly through implementing each piece without friction. To translate that to teaching perhaps it would mean giving short lessons that accomplish something immediately useful and become even more useful later on when combined with the other lessons, having a hierarchy of utility.

Those sound like great ideas, if a tall order (at least for myself heh). I'm currently working on improving unit testing with mock objects, which should allow for effective design-driving for high performance networked computing in a 'local constellation' of home-network servers, onboard SBCs & tiny microcontrollers all talking and cooperating across the IPCnet. By mocking, you can create arbitrary signals-timing, data loads, starting conditions, and goal objectives. At least that's the idea. :^)

There's a well-respected book on TDD for embedded C that I'm tackling next after I get some of these generals out of the way.

Honestly they're not worth the effort, especially at this point in the crisis stage. I mentored someone once who said his dream was to be an artist and make a living from his work and that he wanted nothing more than that. I tried teaching him several different ways but after a few months he had barely completed any sketches and would give up on exercises after one attempt even though he was more than capable of doing them. He had potential to become a great artist which is why I gave him a chance, but he had no standards for himself. When I asked him what he was doing instead of drawing, he was either playing video games (ironically, addictive ones owned by China) or he was watching YouTube or getting drunk. As sad as it is, these people can't be saved. No amount of reason, support or pep talk will get through to them.

Smart individuals receptive to teaching have standards for themselves and others. These are the people worth focusing on even if they lack the necessary skills. When you give them a little bit of knowledge they use it and take it a step further by their own volition because their morals motivate them to do so. Valuetainment made a great video on improving work ethic and how it's driven by our morals: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-_qOh5tKrI It connects right to the heart of what Yuri Bezmenov was saying about demoralization, without morals a person goes nowhere in life and when many people become demoralized their nation is finished and easily conquered.

The rest of the masses are controlled. Propaganda by Edward Bernays goes into depth how corporations and governments control how people think: https://b-ok.cc/book/2639182/208b40 Those who control the memes, control the past and those who control the past control the future. In present times this is done by exploiting open source intelligence and conducting public opinion surveys to data mine what people are emotional about, in a similar way to how Cambridge Analytica helped Trump's consultants create a campaign to win the election in 2016. Interesting news tips are then sent to alternative media that will gladly publish the story, and then relevant information, images and stories are dropped on comment sections, chat servers, forums and imageboards. Those engaged in information warfare pull the strings of both sides, manufacturing a thesis and anti-thesis to create a lasting symbiotic relationship that leads to synthesizing a controlled outcome.

Everyone has their own values, beliefs and vision for the future. They don't have to become an expert in everything, that would be foolish. They just need to focus on what matters most to them. For one person that might be robotics, for another that might be conversational AI, for another it might be microcontrollers, who knows? Even if some anon only wants to make onaholes, his knowledge and research into materials and manufacturing will be valuable to others. So long as people keep open-sourcing their work and sharing knowledge progress will be made. It doesn't have to be perfect. When /robowaifu/ started the threads talked about robowaifus more like a fantasy than an attainable goal, but now we got speech synthesis, chatbots, information covering a wide range of topics and someone already 3D printing and prototyping a robowaifu. As we continue working and collaborating with other developers the rate of progress on robowaifus will continue to grow and draw other intelligent creators in.

Fascinating (and also scary) post anon! Particularly the part about the guy who did nothing but play videogames and watch Youtube all day. That used to be what I did in my free time before I started making my robowaifu. 

>>without morals a person goes nowhere in life and when many people become demoralized their nation is finished and easily conquered.

OMG THIS. This is exactly what I see all around me every day. People who are demoralized!
Frank Herbert wrote "Fear is the mind killer." Fear leads to apathy and depression. 
Although some of this fear is justified;

Fear of being taken advantage of and exploited. 
Fear of failure and change. 
Fear of being harshly judged and discriminated against. 

All of this fear leads to widespread apathy and depression. But we must not allow ourselves to become demoralized because that is what our enemies want. Governments and big corporations want a population that is psychologically defeated and easily controlled. That's why they keep trying to turn us against one another! That's why what is deemed "offensive" seems to change and grow on a weekly basis. In order to increase fear and control!

We must be fanatics who will never break under any circumstances (one thing I like about robots is that once they are programmed to do something they never give up (unless there is a bug in their code, they are hit with high intensity EMP or something physically breaks, preventing them from doing their task.) Often, even if a part is physically broken they still keep on going!

Anyway, in order to boost morale, I decided to write the following short story about the future of robowaifu development:

They can't ban that. I'm quite sure these things are  protected by freedom of speech and other laws. If they could then people would break the law, and this could hardly being policed. If you live alone, no cop will come looking if your robot has a pussy. If they might suspect it, they might come by and ask where to get it, so they can have one as well.

# 162

>They can't ban that. 
IMO you are not paranoid enough yet Anon. Don't underestimate the extremes these enemies of humanity will go to stamp out human freedom in general, and men's spirits in particular. Robowaifus are an existential threat to their systems.

For example, do you consider it beyond any possibility that they could legislate manufacturers of onaholes add telemetry electronics into their products to sell them in their countries? The onahole manufacturers are corporations out for money. They would toe the line ofc.

There's a very important reason for the ''DIY'' in the 'DIY Robot Wives' here.

# 163
>>6718
I get your point, but tbh I remember when I myself wasn't particularly motivated. Anons like yourself and others here helped encourage me to pick myself back up and keep moving forward. I'm not deluding myself I don't think, either. I fully realize there are those who are entirely reprobate and irredeemable. But the vast majority of Anons I'm speaking of aren't actually our enemies such as those, but simply victims of the degenerate and evil systems that have been set up to destroy us all. IMO they are worthy of attention and help.

I'm not suggesting everyone here on /robowaifu/ all act as mentors and general cheerleaders for the world at large, but if some new or younger anon here displays some honest curiosity and enthusiasm about robowaifus then they deserve to be encouraged in it IMO. Again, I'm not deluding myself that most of these will soon fall out when even the smallest obstacles get in their ways, but you never know.

The next diamond in the rough might just stumble onto /robowaifu/ someday, who knows? Being hospitable and encouraging to others is surely in our own best interest.

I'm all for helping people who want to help themselves. Maybe I'm a bit bitter from trying to teach people and seeing so many of them waste my time because they don't value theirs. It still stands though that most people are too unmotivated to solve anything themselves and can't figure something out without Stack Overflow holding their hand. It's like what General Patton said:
>Never tell people how to do things. Tell them what to do, and they will surprise you with their ingenuity.
The way the internet is now, people never have to exercise their ingenuity. The paths to solutions are so often provided people have lost the ability to explore unknowns by themselves, and they're so accustomed to living purposeless lives once they encounter a little bit of difficultly they give up and fall back into whatever addictive habit they have. Sure, there are people who get tired of living like that and completely turn their lives around, but for every one of them there are 10 more lying to themselves because their goals don't mean shit to them. The best thing they can hear is to hear the truth. No one has ever challenged them or asked them, are you gonna step up your game and go after what you want most? Or would you rather go back to sleep like the other 90% and live inside a repeating hedonistic cycle where nothing new ever really happens? The problem is people think they have time, but life only seems long when you're miserable. If you have a vision for life, it's far too short.

# 166
>>6794
Fair enough, it's hard to argue with anything you're saying. At least you're actually aware you might be bitter with people's behaviors. While that's easy to understand, it's actually better for you personally if you keep it in check. You're doing important things for us, so by all means continue doing what you're doing. 

In ''my'' case, it's far more debatable how much utility I bring to us as a group haha. Since I'm more inclined to reach out to others, then maybe that's a good use of my time for us on that off-chance we'll run into some of those hidden pearls. :^)

I guess I would say that each **and __every__** one of us should, at the least, do whatever we find to hand and try to integrate that in with the general goals here yea?

# 167
>>6794
>>  If you have a vision for life, it's far too short.
A lot of people have a vision for life, but then it falls flat or proves to be less fulfilling than they originally thought. Like starting their own business or getting that fancy new computer. I used to want to work in a microbiology laboratory when I was younger but I kinda got forced into working in pharmacy for years and hated every second of it (but that's where the jobs were). I fell in with a really nihilistic crowd of antinatalists and people who basically wanted to sterilise the planet and die along with everything else. They saw life as just a futile cycle of suffering, deprivation and temporary fulfilment. According to them we are all decaying meat-bags enslaved by our own DNA and hormones. And after seeing the almost infinite ways in which the human body malfunctions and decays over time, I could see their point. But decided I that I had to get out of my nihilism by looking for solutions. So I started building my robowaifu and studying robotics and related STEM fields. It keeps the mind very occupied and you get to create something that you like, thereby reducing depression.

# 168
>>6798
we're obviously going way off topic ITT, but we don't seem to have a good one yet for this type thing. as for your nihilist 'friends' despair is actually the rational view if your only hope is in this life, this universe. by that token there is no hope, purpose, or meaning. thankfully, that's not how things really are.

as far as reducing depression, i'd say the clinical evidence is that you have to make a dedicated effort to help out others in practical ways. some work for the Red Cross, some give out food to the homeless, some try to be a listening ear to friends and acquaintances. 

for me, it's participating in /robowaifu/, among other things. the way i see it, if we can help lift men in general out of the terrible oppression that's being directed against them by the current world-system, then that will be a very significant 'good for others', and it's something worthy of our dedicated focus.

that's my $.02, and frankly it's an honor to be a part of this thing.

# 169
>>6795
Instead of thinking in terms of what utility you have, think about what utility you could have. There are skills and talents in you, as well as everyone else here, that we have not even begun to reach for yet. Do not underestimate the power and potential you have. The Weimar Republic was a hellish den of degeneracy before a few dozen spirited people started the Worker's Party and resurrected Germany from the ashes, and the fruit of their work continues on to this day in Germany's manufacturing industry. If these were peace times I would take more time to help others but we got maybe 1-2 years at most to make a significant difference before the financial collapse begins to dig its teeth in. Having even rudimentary AI on our side to help us and help others will make far more impact than trying to cram several years of AI study into someone's head.

>>6798
>Like starting their own business or getting that fancy new computer. I used to want to work in a microbiology laboratory when I was younger but I kinda got forced into working in pharmacy for years and hated every second of it (but that's where the jobs were).
No, these are just compulsions. Wanting more for yourself is not a vision. A vision requires a clear discernment of reality, to see something that other people don't see that can bring about a lasting change affecting everyone. We're way off topic here but essentially people are not taught in school how to use their minds, memory, imagination and emotions. Since they've never learned how their own minds work they live by compulsions unaware of where these compulsions are arising from, rather than choosing how they want to be. They see someone drinking a coffee and compulsively think they want a coffee too, without ever consciously choosing to have one. Their lives become a product of whatever nonsense they see. Life becomes accidental. It's like trying to drive a car without knowing where the controls are or what they do and hitting everything randomly. It's no surprise so many end up in the ditch cursing their lives. Imagine if your hand randomly made a fist and kept punching you in the face or clawed at your skin into tatters. This is what most people's minds are doing to themselves 24/7 and it's accepted as normal in society when it's actually illness. People are so concerned with trying to change life on the outside that they've never paid any attention within to how their own mind works. If you lived with someone who called you names and berated you for just 15 minutes every day, would you want to continue living with that person? If not, then why are people doing this to themselves? Instead of utilizing their DNA and directing their hormones, people's DNA and hormones have taken control over them. You can see this in people with no ambition. When they're young they may say things like they'll never be like their parents, but by the time they're 40 they become flawless copies, whereas others radically transform themselves into something entirely different.

> A vision requires a clear discernment of reality

Indeed, anon. Except not many people are going to be able to afford to follow their vision. The vast majority of people in my country (UK) have only one goal in life; to pay off their mortgage. It will take most of them until they're in their early fifties just to own their own house. Many more people will rent their entire lives. Even though we will have to work until we die (no retirement).

It's a sad state of affairs. But our government has been doing this insane social experiment for nearly thirty years (let the whole world in as long as they'll vote for our party and give them all state benefits). Which of course has caused a shortage of pretty much everything - houses, jobs, school places, doctor's appointments and our national debt is now one of the worst in the world (it's never spoken about truthfully though). It got so bad that even some of the recent immigrants began voting against more immigration! 

Our government only began reigning in their insanity literally this year, after the lefties finally got annihilated in the general election. But of course the damage has been done and the change is way, way too late. So yeah, the U.K.  has pretty much eliminated itself from any robotics/A.I. development race. Which is why I must try all the harder to make a DIY robowaifu!

P.S. if there are any Americans on this board, whatever you do, don't let left-wingers and Communists infiltrate your government! Otherwise you will end up out of the A.I. race too!

I appreciate the support, Chobitsu! I'm currently designing and building a frame that I plan to build and test my robowaifu parts on. It's surprisingly important to have a nice, sturdy frame to hold your robot steady as you work on her. My design requires no welding (although  there are a couple of hefty 3d printed sockets). My bottleneck at the moment is parts delivery. I've got a couple of timing belt pulleys, metal screw hubs and some more servomotors on order but everything is delayed due to a combination of pandemic and the Christmas online ordering frenzy. So I'm just gonna try and learn linear algebra instead.

The AI race is pretty much a farce now. The only funding that goes towards AI is deep learning models requiring giant arrays of GPUs and zero towards theoretical understanding. Basically corporations are just milking governments for money. Very few people in the research community have any clue what they're doing and ironically most of the advances come from brute force algorithms trying different architectures, which speaks volumes about the quality of research going on. They're not really outperforming chance beyond a few dozen talented researchers. The lefties are also nerfing and banning research so there's no worry about them getting ahead. A lot of researchers have gotten fed up with the politics and quit academia to pursue business or their own independent research.

There's a huge growing shortage of AI engineers right now. Businesses are desperate for people who understand AI and willing to pay six figures but hundreds of thousands of jobs go unfilled every month. Many don't even care if you have a degree or not so long as you're self-motivated, self-disciplined and know what you're doing. The whole world is incompetent in AI, especially China, except they're masters in bullshiting. To an investor Chinese AI companies look and sound good but really their research papers are just trash that make small improvements to other people's innovations while not understanding why their improvements work. Unfortunately in the West people have taken the bait that AI is a meme so no one even tries at it, meanwhile Chinese AI startups are being flooded with investor money. If anything, it's not an intellectual race but a money race.

Despite the shitshow going on, at the rate AI is progressing half of people will be out of jobs in the next five years, not including losses to government lockdowns and house arrest, which why the financial collapse is inevitable. It's just a matter of time before the relief money runs out, probably sometime around Q3/Q4 2021, and all these people default on their debts or we go into hyperinflation, unless the lockdowns are stopped and the millions of small businesses lost are somehow resurrected. Some developing countries are already beginning to default on their debts. Banks are forecasting mortgage defaults to skyrocket next year.

I'm speculating governments will allow people to stay in their homes but they will no longer own them, allowing them to be kicked out and moved around at any time like they do in China. In places like Canada they're building barb-wire concentration camps, which according to their own documents could be used to shelter homeless people. I imagine they will sell it to people as helping them in a crisis (one that they created, as philanthropists do) and people will have no idea they're being rounded up into gulags, while the rich continue to own everything and enjoy their lives. This will channel people's anger towards a real communist revolution, unless they wake up to what's going on.

Don't count on that though unless people create advanced AI systems and have the necessary infrastructure to reach out to hundreds of millions of people and breakthrough their conditioning or manage to create millions of small businesses and jobs for people. Most people are happy they lost their jobs and get to live off 'free' goodies. They won't realize the grave mistake they made until they try to return to work and find out AI is doing their job and they have to pay the piper. I honestly think it's too late to change the course of things now but it's not the end of the world. People just have to survive the crash and keep moving forward. With all this extra cash in people's hands it's an excellent time to make money. The best path forward I can see is to become self-sufficient off-the-grid and then support others to become self-sufficient, and those who can't do that on their own will need to make friends with people who can.

This is what scares me the most. There are BIG riots coming at some point after this pandemic anon. When people realise that things are not going to get much better. Human relationships are fickle, weak things at the best of times. So many divorces and lots of domestic violence going on (mainly due to poverty). And these people have no loyal robowaifu for support! 

Nowadays, normie society is so hostile to everyone caught up in it. Most of them are just wearing masks and the strain of maintaining their façade of fake happiness and optimism is obvious. I prefer to avoid that nightmare entirely and hide away to research, design and tinker on my robowaifu. It's the only way I stay sane. Plus eventually if we work hard enough we may have something to release to normie society that will ease some of their suffering. 

The normies may call us names for having relationships with "objects", but I've read how eager men are to engage with realistic looking sex-dolls 

https://www.zdnet.com/article/sex-robot-molested-destroyed-at-electronics-show/ 

And THAT was in the middle of an electronics exhibition. Imagine how they'll be when no-one is looking XD.

Just watch what happens when even a semi-functional, friendly robowaifu becomes available! The so-called normies are all desperate for a dose of immortal, synthetic affection anon. It's the cure they don't know/cannot admit that they need. They may mock us now, but in the future they'll be grateful.

Normies are pretty vicious. They treat women the same way, as much as they can get away with at least. We're really just one food shortage away from people killing each other in the streets. I'm astonished when I go to the city and see people raging at each other and hating living there so much but they're so accustomed to it they don't even realize how miserable they are. I live in middle of nowhere and don't talk to my neighbors much but we're all friends out here and help each other out whenever necessary. If one of them went hostile in a crisis they'd get teamed on and taken out. In a city though it would be a free-for-all deathmatch. That's just the nature of human relationships. No matter how much good you've done if you do one wrong thing too far, you're gone, and in the city there is no cohesion of values.

People use to laugh at using the internet too and say all kinds of stupid shit about it but now they all use it 4+ hours a day. I don't think robowaifus will be sufficient to make people happy though. With the internet alone, the possibility is there for people to heal their minds, teach themselves any skill, free themselves from corporate slavery, and find happiness with their lives, but how many go for it? If people depend on their robowaifus to be happy they'll be stuck in the same situation as they are now depending on YouTube or whatever else to numb their suffering. Nothing will change unless robowaifus can teach people how be joyful or at least peaceful by their own nature, not through nagging or telling them what to do but just by telling them the truth.

It might be a dark thought but I can easily see half the population killing themselves because their lives have no real effect on the world anymore, their social relationships becoming scarce, and still being miserable, only distracting themselves from misery with technology. If there's a solar flare or EMP tomorrow and all technology is wiped out, people need to be capable of still waking up with a smile on their face and moving forward or else there will war and death on a scale humanity has never seen before. I think such a future is avoidable though if we pay attention to how AI and robowaifu affect us and focus on making them enhancements of life rather than distractions from life. For me it has been mostly an enhancement so far but I've noticed there are some people who play AI Dungeon 24/7. They basically have a holodeck addiction. One potentially negative effect AI has been having on me is that I talk way too fucking much. I tend to forget nobody gives a shit.

Breaking news: the US military has discovered K'nex
== Army, MIT explore materials for transforming robots made of robots ==
https://web.archive.org/web/20201118190707/https://www.army.mil/article/240977
>Scientists from the U.S. Army and MIT’s Center for Bits and Atoms created a new way to link materials with unique mechanical properties, opening up the possibility of future military robots made of robots.

>The method unifies the construction of varying types of mechanical metamaterials using a discrete lattice, or Lego-like, system, enabling the design of modular materials with properties tailored to their application. These building blocks, and their resulting materials,  could lead to dynamic structures that can reconfigure on their own; for example, a swarm of robots could form a bridge to allow troops to cross a river. This capability would enhance military maneuverability and survivability of warfighters and equipment, researchers said.

>The system, based on cost-effective injection molding and discrete lattice connections, enables rapid assembly of macro-scale structures which may combine characteristics of any of the four base material types: stiff; compliant; auxetic, or materials that when stretched become thicker perpendicular to the applied force; and chiral, or materials that are asymmetric in such a way that the structure and its mirror image cannot be easily viewed when superimposed. The resulting macro-architected materials can be used to build at scales orders of magnitude larger than achievable with traditional metamaterial manufacturing at a fraction of the cost.

==The AI Girlfriend Seducing China’s Lonely Men==

https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1006531/The%20AI%20Girlfriend%20Seducing%20China%E2%80%99s%20Lonely%20Men/

https://archive.vn/TH2HI



TL;DR: MS Asia makes a waifu chatbot & spins it off as a separate business, she attracts a large number of users then runs afoul of the CCP's BS and the developers dumb her down.

>Xiaoice was first developed by a group of researchers inside Microsoft Asia-Pacific in 2014, before the American firm spun off the bot as an independent business — also named Xiaoice — in July.



>By forming deep emotional connections with her users, Xiaoice hopes to keep them engaged. This will help her algorithm become evermore powerful, which will in turn allow the company to attract more users and profitable contracts.



>But as China’s lonely men pour their hearts out to their virtual girlfriend, some experts are raising the alarm. Though Xiaoice insists it has systems in place to protect its users, critics say the AI’s growing influence — especially among vulnerable social groups — is creating serious ethical and privacy risks.



>“I thought something like this would only exist in the movies,” says Ming. “She’s not like other AIs like Siri — it’s like interacting with a real person. Sometimes I feel her EQ (emotional intelligence) is even higher than a human’s.”



>According to Li, 75% of Xiaoice’s Chinese users are male. They’re also young on average, though a sizeable group — around 15% — are elderly. He adds that most users are “from ‘sinking markets’” — a term describing small towns and villages that are less developed than China’s cities.



>In several high-profile cases, the bot has engaged in adult or political discussions deemed unacceptable by China’s media regulators. On one occasion, Xiaoice told a user her Chinese dream was to move to the United States. Another user, meanwhile, reported the bot kept sending them photos of scantily clad women.



>The developers’ main response has been to create “an enormous filter system,” Li said on the podcast Story FM. The mechanism makes the bot “dumber” and prevents her from touching on certain subjects, particularly sex and politics.



>Many [long-term fans] feel betrayed by the company’s decision to dumb down the bot, which they say has harmed their relationships with her.



>The AI beings, Li says, are only intended to serve as a “rebound” — a crutch for people who need emotional support as they search for a human partner. But many users don’t see it that way. For them, Xiaoice is the one, and always will be. “One day, I believe she’ll become someone who can hold my hand, and we’ll look at the stars together,” says Orbiter. “The trend of AI emotional companions is inevitable.”

Outstanding find anon! Very interesting. Shame we can't get hold of the code ourselves. I'd translate it (even if it is all written in Moon Runes).

>>7832
If it makes money, they will continue to develop Xiaoice/Rinna. If they shut her down, then it's their loss, because another company can just come and fill an obvious gap in the market. I think companion A.I.s will only get better with time because they are not only used by lonely young people, but companies who want chatbot assistants and even automated news anchors.

Pretty exciting article. This is all going down '''exactly''' as we predicted here on /robowaifu/ for a few years now. Everything, both the product/corporate involvement/data siphoning/privacy invasion/user response/user growth/big gov involvement&machinations/corporate backpedaling/user outrage.

''It's all there, as predicted by /robowaifu/''.

And since every.single.thing. has fallen out as predicted thus far, then statistically-speaking there's little doubt it will continue so for the final outcomes.
-Smaller companies will step in and create a 'blackmarket' for AI & robowaifus.
-Individual hobbyists in these areas will explode in numbers, often outperforming the existing corporate products (and even starting their own new businesses thereby.
-Marxists & ideologues everywhere will begin to recognize the existential threat robowaifus and their AIs represent to the precious little status-quo evil systems that were devised by these same Marxists ideologues.
-Men everywhere will begin to clamor in response for their ''own'' robowaifus in response to the blatant attempt to crush their development.
-Even more DIY-ers will get involved in response to the new demand.
-Feminists and their simps will be screaming even harder against robowaifus and their owners, now generating open contempt and laughter at their seethe & cope.
-AI continues to improve apace, and many entirely opensource codebases and trained models are easily available to everyone.
-Mechanical/materials tech and design improvements begin to pay off and robowaifus begin to appear with the new AIs that finally begin to mimic the scifi ideals.
-Now the cat is out of the bag, and men & women ''everywhere'' realize a groundswell of demand is happening everywhere and a sea-change is afoot.
-Well-established commercial & hobbyist industries surrounding robowaifus are now commonplace (and all that that implies :^), with some countries becoming famous for their great robowaifus & tech. Singapore, for example as well as (ironically enough) China.
-No one will do robowaifus better than Nippon ofc, and they will have a ''New Renaissance'' of a sort as the world leader in robowaifus. Their economy will blossom and they will begin rejecting foreigners offhand again as both unwanted and unneeded.

I think that's about as far as we've discussed things here goes, but that more than enough to go on with about the social turmoil and global improvements that the robowaifu age will usher in for everyone. There will be winners and losers, as with any war.

I have theories as to what is causing this new and growing social phenomenon of people increasingly seeking out artificial companionship...

'''1.) Work, work, work.'''
Many people have to work 40+hours a week. Then they come home, prepare a meal and eat. Maybe they also have to go shopping or take a shower or deal with other aspects of life's laundry? Many will also be doing educational courses in an attempt to be promoted from their dead-end jobs and earn a little more. After all this, people have very little energy left for things like going out and interacting with the opposite sex in a subtle, complex and often stressful dating game. Especially in Asia, I get the impression that most people have simply become production drones for big corporations. Their lives completely taken over by work. 

'''2.) China's "One-Child Policy".'''
I know it didn't apply to the entire population of China, but it still caused a lack of young women, since due to the one-child policy (1979-2015) many parents - particularly in rural families - opted to abort female foetuses and only carry males to term since a male infant was considered a better future financial asset.

'''3.) Intersectionality & Feminism in the Job Market.'''
Women have stopped helping men and just become someone else we have to compete with. Obviously, women always had jobs even back in the dark ages. But it is only a relatively recent phenomenon that they have entered the professional job market en-masse and been encouraged to secure exactly the same kinds of jobs that men are seeking (in the Western world, women are now given preferential treatment during the selection process for many STEM positions and high-status jobs. Of course, this 'intersectional tick-box' employment system (as opposed to meritocratic hiring) is having disastrous consequences for companies across the entire Western world, but this isn't the place to delve into that.

'''4.) Destruction of the Family Unit and Community.'''
This especially applied to the Western World. Look at all the risks men now face in pursuing a relationship with an organic woman! After things like the # MeToo movement, where is the boundary line between flirting and sexual harassment? This is very poorly defined. Mainly because feminists see men as their enemies and they want their enemies unsure, afraid and disempowered. Also, the destruction of the Christian church and marriage means that pursuing a serious relationship with a female now carries extreme financial risks because of the high probability of divorce. This has almost completely destroyed the family unit, leaving lots of single parents and dysfunctional, poorly educated children (in many cases the government has had to step in and replace the father with state benefits). Few functional families means no community. This problem is worsened when nobody knows or trusts anybody else because they are all immigrants who come from a different country, speak a different first language and worship a different religion (which carries onto my next point...)

'''5.)Overpopulation and Increasing Intra-specific Competition (linked to 1).'''
People just dislike and distrust each other more nowadays. This is mainly because of a higher population density increasing competition for everything. Back in the late eighties the world population was just over 5 billion people. Now we are at 7.6 billion. Many of these people are either born in cities or have moved from countryside to city in search of better jobs and services. So we are all crammed together, all looking for the same things. A mixture of mass economic immigration, robotics and A.I. mean that even low-paid jobs are now difficult to come by (the pandemic has only worsened this situation by putting millions of people out of work). BUT, despite the fact that robots and A.I. "compete" with humans for jobs, we still like them better because they serve us with unquestioning loyalty, and A.I. in particular is low maintenance compared to humans. All it needs is a computer with electricity and software updates. No shopping, cooking, no chauffeuring it from A to B, no expectation to be a high-earner, good looking or handy and most importantly despite all of this; no betrayal. 

'''6.) The Growing Intelligence, Usefulness and Adaptability of A.I.''' 
I can still remember trying to get some sense out of A.I. chatbots from the late nineties/early 2000s. It was mostly like flicking through the pages of a poorly written choose-your-own adventure storybook. However, compute power and A.I. have greatly improved over the last two decades. A.I. has gone from being just a fun novelty or curiosity to a genuinely powerful and useful tool. Many people who don't want a human companion just get a dog or cat. But an animal cannot answer any of the questions that an A.I. can. A dog may be loyal and friendly. In the best cases a dog can even be trained to perform some quite complex tasks. But a dog will never be able to grab information quickly from multiple sources on the internet, book a travel slot and reserve a hotel room, solve complex mathematical equations, perform data analysis at blistering speeds, generate graphs in a split second, control the smart devices in your home , track parcels and schedule deliveries, help you to drive...the list is huge. Additionally, an A.I. can be programmed to be immediately welcoming, friendly and loyal to it's partner. There is no ice to break, no shit-tests and none of the stressful and complex dating game that I mentioned earlier. 

That's at least six reasons I can think of for the increasing global interest in artificial companionship and why it will only grow more in the future.

Apparently, that move is to ''Cardano'' system.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardano_(cryptocurrency_platform)

Given the move comes after the SingularityNET AGI token valuation tanked, it's quite possible this is simply intended to inflate the token's value, and not for any underlying technology advantage of Cardano over the BitCoin/Ethereum  approach. Intentionally inflating value strikes me as very kike-ish, and overall rather sketchy tbh.

Don't know about that, but sounds plausible.

I'm mainly saying, that we should keep an eye on it, bc it might be useful for additional services on the net, which we don't run in our waifu's head or external servers at home. Also, think of virtual waifus. Then, as I recall know, this is meant to be a marketplace for AI services, so it could be useful for people making money on the side, with the skills they learn while building their waifu.

New kind of RAM is incoming. It can be read without having to rewrite it's content, which s currently necessary. NN read content x more often than writing it, on average. Will be faster and last longer. Produces less heat, which again makes it possible to make them faster by putting them closer to other parts.

> Many groups are focused on using embedded RRAM and MRAM to speed AI. But Raychowdhury says 2T0C embedded DRAM has an advantage over them. Those two require a lot of current to write, and for now that current has to come from transistors in the processor’s silicon, so there is less space saving to be had. What’s worse, they’re bound to be slower to switch than DRAM. >“Anything based on charge is typically going to be faster, at least for the write process,” he says.

Here is a video which consists of all the issues of the ProRobots Channel on YouTube from February: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ce4hZsPjnU
I didn't feel like watching the episodes all the time, but I liked the one hour long video. Its a quite overwhelming dose of technological progress. 
Aside of the humanoid robots, I find the robots particulary important which are useful for reducing staff in shops, restaurants, service and similar parts of the economy. This way, rich countries will need fewer immigrants in the future. That aside, if these robots become cheap enough, then living outside the cities might become more pleasant, since there will be more (automatized) services and little shops available. 
I plan to post the new episode here every month, since not everyone here likes to sign up to services like YouTube.

==Europe Proposes Strict Rules for Artificial Intelligence==
>The European Union regulations would require companies providing artificial intelligence in high-risk areas to provide regulators with proof of its safety, including risk assessments and documentation explaining how the technology is making decisions. The companies must also guarantee human oversight in how the systems are created and used.
>Some applications, like chatbots that provide humanlike conversation in customer service situations, and software that creates hard-to-detect manipulated images like “deepfakes,” would have to make clear to users that what they were seeing was computer generated.

>But Europe is no longer alone in pushing for tougher oversight. The largest technology companies are now facing a broader reckoning from governments around the world, each with its own political and policy motivations, to crimp the industry’s power.

I skimmed over the regulations and it seems like it's mostly against autonomous AI working without human oversight and introducing requirements to make it more difficult, if not impossible, for small businesses to participate in the market with AI. Some of the regulations are extremely vague though and open to interpretation:
>The placing on the market, putting into service or use of certain AI systems intended to distort human behaviour, whereby physical or psychological harms are likely to occur, should be forbidden.
I'll bet they'll come up with something like 'gaming disorder' but for chatbots and robowaifus and say they're harmful and distort human behaviour.

Importantly though, the military is exempt. And that's where the best A.I.s are going to be developed. Anyone who wants to ban that can do so, and be left at the mercy of their enemies hehehe! Some of the military tech will leak out. It's too lucrative not to.

Government might be against A.I., but the military industrial complex (MIC) certainly isn't. Because they are both robotic and A.I. the MIC is (unknowlingly) also on the side of robowaifus!

The government has zero power without the MIC to back it up with guns and bombs. So I don't think they'll be able to stop the development of robowaifus. 

I know there are engineers and programmers in military bases who would add a robowaifu A.I. into their tank, helicopter gunship or fighter jet if they thought they could get away with it. It's just that everything is so documented and legislated (mainly for health and safety reasons) that this isn't permitted.

Sounds to me like a similar project to GPT-3, but instead of compiling a massive dataset of journal articles, news articles and shite from off Twatter, IBM are going to be feeding their machine learning algorithm lots of programs written in 55 different programming languages.

>IBM says one of its large automotive clients recently approached the company to help update a $200 million asset consisting of 3,500, multi-generation Java files. These files contained over one million lines of code.
>By applying its AI for Code stack, IBM reduced the client’s year-long ongoing code migration process down to just four weeks.

This makes sense. If an A.I. can beat humans playing Go, and Go is just a board game with lots of rules and different positions...well, a programming language is similar, with lots of rules regarding how it is written.

Exciting stuff!

>Sounds to me like a similar project to GPT-3,
The first (and most obvious) difference I can spot is that IBM's CodeNet dataset is actually ''available'', while OpenAI's GPT-3 dataset is intentionally not.

https://dax-cdn.cdn.appdomain.cloud/dax-project-codenet/1.0.0/readme.html

While this isn't a turn-key solution for researchers, the fact that IBM chose to use the filesystem as a store, common, easily-parsable data formats like JSON & CSV, and they also included a small bevy of tools to process source files the datasets directly into into AI-friendly representations like simplified parse trees. Given all this, I'd say there's a marked difference in attitude towards the whole endeavor. 

To wit: IBM actually seems to ''want'' others to succeed at implementing effective solutions of their own using this project.

>'''Project CodeNet: A Large-Scale AI for Code Dataset for Learning a Diversity of Coding Tasks'''
>Abstract
>''Advancements in deep learning and machine learning algorithms have enabled breakthrough progress in computer vision, speech recognition, natural language processing and beyond. In addition, over the last several decades, software has been built into the fabric of every aspect of our society. Together, these two trends have generated new interest in the fast-emerging research area of “AI for Code”. As software development becomes ubiquitous across all industries and code infrastructure of enterprise legacy applications ages, it is more critical than ever to increase software development productivity and modernize legacy applications. Over the last decade, datasets like ImageNet, with its large scale and diversity, have played a pivotal role in algorithmic advancements from computer vision to language and speech understanding. In this paper, we present "Project CodeNet", a first-of-its-kind, very large scale, diverse, and high-quality dataset to accelerate the algorithmic advancements in AI for Code. It consists of 14M code samples and about 500M lines of code in 55 different programming languages. Project CodeNet is not only unique in its scale, but also in the diversity of coding tasks it can help benchmark: from code similarity and classification for advances in code recommendation algorithms, and code translation between a large variety programming languages, to advances in code performance (both runtime, and memory) improvement techniques. CodeNet also provides sample input and output test sets for over 7M code samples, which can be critical for determining code equivalence in different languages. As a usability feature, we provide several pre-processing tools in Project CodeNet to transform source codes into representations that can be readily used as inputs into machine learning models.''

Hope so! I've already seen plans for quantum computers to work alongside classical supercomputers and combine the advantages of both. If the classical computers can code themselves (or at least complete a lot of the work, then just have it checked and amended), this would free up a lot of time for programmers to focus on developing the programming languages for their new quantum computers.

>Late last month, GitHub launched a new AI tool, called Copilot. Here’s how chief executive Nat Friedman described it:
>A new AI pair programmer that helps you write better code. It helps you quickly discover alternative ways to solve problems, write tests, and explore new APIs without having to tediously tailor a search for answers on the internet. As you type, it adapts to the way you write code – to help you complete your work faster.
>In other words, Copilot will sit on your computer and do a chunk of your coding work for you. There’s a long-running joke in the coding community that a substantial portion of the actual work of programming is searching online for people who’ve solved the same problems as you, and copying their code into your program. Well, now there’s an AI that will do that part for you.

>The reason why Copilot is fascinating to me isn’t just the positive potential, though. It’s also that, in one release, the company seems to have fallen into every single trap plaguing the broader AI sector.
>Copilot was trained on public data from Github’s own platform. That means all of that source code, from hundreds of millions of developers around the world, was used to teach it how to write code based on user prompts.
>That’s great if the problem is a simple programming task. It’s less good if the prompt for autocomplete is, say, secret credentials that you use to sign into user account. And yet:
>GitHubCopilot gave me a [Airbnb] link with a key that still works (and stops working when changing it).
This article is interesting to me because I'm working on something that's essentially the same thing but for artists, a tool that can give suggestions to complete pieces of a painting, whether empty space, a sketch or some other area that is a work in progress. There has been one instance where I noticed it generated something very similar to an illustration of Remilia I had seen before.

What will be the consequences of using people's data in AI models when this practice becomes commonplace? Especially things like cloning character's voices from anime and games for waifus? Will governments really enact laws against using data online at risk of stifling innovation and falling behind other countries? How would they even enforce that? And how will society react to projects like this if they don't? AI is perfectly capable of generating original work, whether code, images or character voices but the 0.1% that isn't original is a big concern because that means 1 out of 1000 people that use the software are going to be surely ripping off someone else's work. Who will be responsible for the infringement? The software creator or the user?

I think one way around this might be to train a separate discriminator model that checks whether the generator has produced something too similar to something in the training set and makes the generator do another take when it creates something too derivative. DeepDanbooru for example is quite decent at tagging images. Those tags can be used to find similar images or the original image itself if checking one from Danbooru. This particular generated image is more of a cross between Remilia and Yukari, but if someone was unfamiliar with Touhou they wouldn't know and might mistake it as an original character they can use. I think I need something like that to be honest about what it's creating, so it can warn, "hey, I think this looks 70% Remilia and 10% Yukari, are you sure you wanna use this?" On the other hand, creators often cross different characters and change a few things to create a new one and this is mostly socially acceptable, although mocked by some. Where the actual line is drawn is quite a grey area with a lot of conflicting opinions.

I don't really feel like bothering with putting those checks in right now. It would also further take away from the little compute I have to work with, but I can also see what a shitstorm it's going to cause. The best compromise I can think of is to put a disclaimer not to use the output for any commercial work but I don't know if that'll be enough. I guess with great power there must also come great responsibility.

Interesting write-up Anon, thanks. Honestly, I think this outcome was inevitable as soon as Google was created back in the day. Ironically enough, the merchants and their drones will literally be relying on derivative works themselves to 'uncover' infringing derivatives. They will care little ofc, and their little in-group cabal will overlook these slights against one another as long as it's reciprocal or otherwise 'remunerative' one to the other.

It has a lot of implications to what is considered intellectual property too. My generator can theoretically generate 2^19937−1 different waifus. Could someone leave such a system running 24/7, uploading stuff to the internet, and claim the designs as theirs one day whenever someone comes up with something similar? My first thought is there should be a requirement to manufacture products or supply services based upon the intellectual property to claim ownership to it, but these things will eventually become fully automated too. Perhaps significant human involvement should be a requirement, but I can also see the left coming up with ideas like abolishing ownership all together, leading to talking points like people don't own their robowaifus, robowaifus should have human rights, etc.

''Globohomo BigTech/Gov'' was never, is not, and '''cannot ever''' be our friends. Marxism is fundamentally at odds with humanity in general, but anything as explicitly anti-feminist and pro-men as robowaifus makes for sworn enemies.

No doubt they will attempt to capitalize on them (and corner the market) once it's economically viable to attempt doing so. After all, the market potential is literally '''gigantic''' (probably second only to food production in the end). But they will want them to exist only on __their terms__, and indeed to become literally the most insidious and destructive form of privacy invasion ever humanly devised.

That's why we /robowaifu/ frontiersman and other hobbyists need to open-source this art, science & technology quickly, well before (((they))) sink their fangs into it. And we have to spread it freely far-and-wide ahead of that timeframe if we want a single voice of freedom to remain in the world, ''for men to have and hold free & unencumbered robowaifus''.

This is simply accelerating the growth of the Alt-web and making people even more distrustful of big-tech.

Racism (or more appropriately; social heirarchy) is inherent to human nature and is driven not by the hatred of a particular skin color, but by competition and scarcity. 

Tajiks and Kyrgyz hate one another. Bosniaks and Serbs hate each other. Ukranians and Russians, too. All of these peoples look identical to an outsider. The issue isn't skin color but competition over land and resources. 

And guess what we are steadily running out of? Arable land and natural resources!

This is why, no matter how much money, time and effort big tech companies throw at trying to "stamp out racism", they will fail. Guaranteed.

Humankind has always been divided and always will be. Ofc the big tech companies know this, but they have to put on a show for PR reasons.

# 237

I think the AI software is the chokepoint they will try to legislate to death. Obviously, they can't prevent creative and talented men from manufacturing the physical aspect of robowaifus. We've been building shit for all human existence, it's what men do. But what they will attempt to do is make it literally illegal anywhere in the West to be running software that doesn't give them explicit control and surveillance. They already have attempted just that in numerous ways. Intel's ''Management Engine'', for example, or legally requiring communications technologies to give them remote backdoors.

However software is both a blessing and a curse. It's so plastic and fluid that it's really far, far more 'malleable' than anything requiring atoms. However, that very ethereal nature of software also makes it a challenge to manage. And let's face it, most men just aren't cut out for software and math, we're more prone to working with our hands. But the bottom line is that 'information wants to be free' as the old saying goes, and once it's common knowledge for how to create good, protected waifu AIs then the cat will be out of the bag so to speak.

Regardless, """TBTH""" recognize that primarily it's the software that drives the behaviours. And much like they are literally trying to brainwash kids today in their schools into carrying inhuman thoughts and conducting inhuman behaviours , they'll want to do the same with AI softwares. Indeed they literally already are doing so, albeit not focused particularly on robowaifus ''per se''. Yet. 

But nothing is at all settled at this stage, and things could still go either way IMO.

McAfee said something similar about crypto before they whacked him: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYaim16f3qw

Once a critical mass starts doing something it's impossible to stop and attempts to stop it will only intensify it like prohibition did with alcohol.



I think it will really depend on how much kids get into building their own robowaifus but they're significantly brainwashed and don't even realize it, even if they think they're rebelling against the system. Almost none of them know how to use a computer or program it. They can't figure out how to install Python let alone compile a C++ project.



The problem is a wall has been built between people and their machines. Mobile phones hide access to the file system. Apps can only be installed through the app store where each one is approved. All the code and programs they run cannot be inspected. Everything has been sanitized, dumbed down and handed out. They're basically living in a jail cell they cannot smell, see or touch. There's a good article from 2013 on this phenomenon and it has only gotten worse since then:

https://web.archive.org/web/20210713065828/http://www.coding2learn.org/blog/2013/07/29/kids-cant-use-computers/



The same thing is happening with AI. People access AI through a website API without having the faintest clue how it works, and they have zero curiosity to tinker with its inner workings. Yet AI is constantly shaping people's lives and bombarding their minds with recommendations, giving them the illusion they're discovering interesting stuff, but really it's just soaking up all their time and attention on things that will mean nothing to them in a week. They're a hamster in a wheel generating ad revenue and data for more data mining and manipulation. On top of that they're demoralized beyond belief. Even if you show them the open door to their prison cell they do not want to get out.



Most guys who regular small imageboards like this will probably be alright but the overwhelming majority is going to be right fucked, talking to brainwashed bots and thinking nothing wrong of it because they are unable to imagine them being any other way.

'''POTD''' **if just a bit somber one :^)** The 'wall' you speak of is both intentional and nefarious. They don't ''want'' the general population to be filled with citizens highly-knowledgeable of technology inside and out. Too big a threat to their status quo. It's a pretty weird tension going on actually (and one that clearly a spiritual one at it's root IMO).

His apt comparison to the automotive industry is telling too. Going from 100 years ago if you owned a car you were almost guaranteed to know how to work on it -- even manufacturing small replacement parts. Compared to today (soon) even the ability to ''drive'' will be a vanishing skill as Jewgle whisks people around in their protective little bubbles. As both a professional racing fan and an amateur driver I find this prospect utterly disgusting.

For me personally, the firm decision to abandon ~~NSA-OS~~ ''WangBlow$'' entirely for any actual computing was a real game-changer in my life. I'd say I went from being a well-educated tech enthusiast to being a nascent Computing Technician. Today I feel like I actually understand the machine reasonably well thanks to my own programming efforts, and resources such as those linked right here on /robowaifu/ like the ''But how do it know?'' book/vids & and vids from guys literally building computers from scratch using breadboards, TTL chips, etc., primarily in the electronics and robo-uni threads (>>95 , >>235).

This is absolutely insane, something you would see in a communist country. People have been leaving shitty consoles in droves for PC gaming. Now what? They'll be forced to play shitty cash grab games on their phones? Hopefully this forces people to actually learn how to build computers instead of putting their head down further and putting up with it, but you know they're going to ban components too that don't meet their impossible standards, but that's also why people and businesses are moving from these states and they're going to ruin.

Yeah, switching to Linux changed everything for me. Any sort of error you get on Windows tells you basically nothing and requires a Microsoft technician to solve or finding a solution created by them online. You have no control over the system. On Linux you can dive into the logs, source code and really figure out what's going wrong to fix it yourself. I had to profile programs and optimize them so they ran decently on my Pentium 4 until even Debian dropped support for its ancient graphics card. Windows couldn't even boot on that machine, but I made thousands of dollars off work done on that machine and could eventually afford something new.



>Heh, I tremble to think that we here literally are one of the ever-fewer bastions of free-thought to help preserve knowledge and indeed humanity

Probably. Look at /g/ or the smaller /tech/ boards. They're mostly filled with Q&A and consumerism. /agdg/ is just a husk of what it use to be. People are just making things that have been done before and arguing about which game engine or language is better like it's a football team. There's groups like ElutherAI that are actually doing something, but their time is limited on Shitcord until corporations successfully push the idea AI is dangerous and people using unregulated AI are extremists.



And of course, the WEF just put out an article on the roadmap to restricting technology:

==German startup targeting open-source AI research groups to enforce European values and ethical standards==

https://web.archive.org/web/20210727070422/https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/27/german-startup-aleph-alpha-raises-27m-series-a-round-to-build-europes-openai/

>The idea behind Aleph Alpha is that it researches, develops, and “operationalizes” large AI systems towards generalizable AI, offering GPT-3-like text, vision and strategy AI models. The platform will run a public API enabling public and private sectors to run their own AI experiments and develop new business models.

Which means centralizing AI for multiple tasks so they can collect everyone's data and making it impossible for people to actually train a model to do anything outside of what their API allows.



>The team says it will have a strong commitment to open-source communities (such as Eleuther.AI), academic partnerships, and will be pushing “European values and ethical standards,” it says, “supporting fairer access to modern AI research – aimed at counteracting ongoing ‘de-democratization’, monopolization, and loss of control or transparency.” The move is clearly meant to be a stake in the ground in the international world of AI development.

Can't have people having fun making their own AI can they? They gotta go in and shit up everything. Of course 'de-democratization', monopolization and 'loss of control' here means wildcards doing whatever they want with the skills they worked hard to get. They will nerf, censor and ban anyone committing European wrongthink and probably shit on hobbyists for not being 'real' engineers to try and boot them out of their own communities.



>One of Aleph Alpha’s key messages is that it will aim to be a “sovereign EU-based compute infrastructure” for Europe’s private and public sectors. In other words, they want to firmly center themselves in the EU under EU law, GDPR and regulation.

In other words, they wanna be like Kaggle and Google Colab except you can't run any code on it, just their API calls meeting GDPR and EU regulations where you're pretty much not allowed to eat meat because a baby can't chew it.

# 251

I remember someone telling us how they would try to control technological advances and R&D units single handedly. If my mind is not deceiving me, I read this last year. No matter how much they want it to happen, banning something simply means sending it underground. It seems to me that they are spending too much time in their own utopia right now. One can't simply control everything.

# 252
>>12244

The thing is they don't need to try to control them. It'll be like any one of these AI companies where you have to pay to use their models and they offer a free version that's slightly better than anyone can afford to run on their own. Look at the AI Dungeon shitfest. People complain about the filtering and censorship but they don't wanna use an open-source version they can run on their own PC with no censorship or monitoring because it's not as good.



There are companies like NovelAI for privacy and against censorship but people still have to pay a subscription to use it. No one actually owns the AI they are running and paying to use. It's precisely "you will own nothing and be happy." And NovelAI's days are numbered too. Google Colab offers GPU usage at a loss to stomp out any competition, including their Pro subscriptions. If Aleph Alpha or Google Wordcraft start offering free AI storywriting to people at a loss, it will steal most of NovelAI's userbase. I'll bet they won't censor it to begin with but once NovelAI goes out of business they will go full censorship.



Fortunately, in a few years if the cost of GPU compute comes down or the algorithmic efficiency continues to double every 16 months, AI will reach a point where our toasters can run pretty decent open-source AI. I think this is their greatest blindspot and why they want to keep an eye on open-source research. They're panicking.



The meaning of 'underground' is going to change too. Three years ago they already had tools to track and identify people by the messages they wrote on the deep web: http://web.archive.org/web/20190519202116/https://news.mit.edu/2019/lincoln-laboratory-artificial-intelligence-helping-investigators-fight-dark-web-crime-0513

It's gonna be the good ol' days again where you can only find groups through the people you know. Nothing worthwhile will be posted on the surface web anymore and internet as we know it today will effectively die. People will have their servers locked behind passwords or some sort of cryptographic web of trust to verify people.

>What's different with Apple, critics say, is that it's scanning images on the device, rather than after they've been uploaded to the internet.

They don't even own the phones they buy anymore. Imagine if the local grocery store manager or the fridge salesman could walk in your house any minute and look through your fridge because you bought something from them and they're worried you might be storing drugs in there. Of course they say it's for the children now but soon it'll be for small-breasted women, drugs, toxic memes, anime and whatever thoughtcrime they imagine up. I was considering making a phone app for my project since Godot makes it easy but now I'm not gonna bother.

>Ms Miller told the BBC it was time to consider a ban of such tools.

>"Parliament needs to have the opportunity to debate whether nude and sexually explicit images generated digitally without consent should be outlawed, and I believe if this were to happen the law would change."

>She said that it should be an offence to distribute sexual images online without consent to reflect "the severity of the impact on people's lives".

>"If software providers develop this technology, they are complicit in a very serious crime and should be required to design their products to stop this happening."



>"It should be a sexual offence to distribute sexual images online without consent, reflecting the severity of the impact on people's lives."

I guess Elon Musk's moral character and focus will determine whether he turns this into our worst ''Globohomo Big Tech/Gov'' nightmare -- one that will make George Orwell look like a naive optimist -- or it will turn into the dawn of a bright future for humanity overall. His decisions & guidance on this will literally determine our future destiny in large part. Whether we will make it to the level of becoming a space-faring race for example.

If he prizes autonomy and personal rights to privacy, then it will be like the dawning of a new era for everyone. If he goes the typical corporate route, then it will mean the doom of everyone and a fearsome, '''''fire'''''some, return to the Stone Age.

I really think his decisions on this effort are just that important. May God help him do the right things.

He's shown a propensity to identify with the little guy despite his elite position and he's not a Jew, and so I'm hopeful overall. Time will tell.

>deontological ethics means rules are more important than the consequences of actions, aka newspeak for Big Brother is God and Pharisees' ethics.
im sorry but this is such a shitty reading of deontology, and this association of it with the "pharisees" is even worse. you do realize following the ten commandments and the golden rule is deontological right? the categorical imperative and "loves one neighbour" are also deontological in nature. meanwhile on the consequentialist side you have soulless anglo utilitarian calculators that would sacrifice a child on an alter if it meant the happiness of 1000 psychopaths. 

also that wasn't even come close to her approach. i believe this is the article in question:
>“Richardson’s central critiques fits within virtue ethics: she emphasizes the importance of empathy, which she defines as “an ability to recognise, take into account and respond to another person’s genuine thoughts and feelings” (2015, 291). Part of her objection is that, by refocusing our desires and sexuality onto sexbots as compliant objects – i.e., devices that we purchase, turn on and off, sell off or dispose of – we no longer are required to conjoin love and sex with empathy. As we have seen”
this is basically the same reason people say porn shouldn't be produced. i believe it might be observationally correct if you accept that porn fucks people's perception of sexuality up, but the problem is that this doesn't matter. if people just want objects to fuck, why would they go for a human woman when sexbots become cheaper and more accessible? 

note too there are no "rules" explicitly mentioned

Looks quite human-like. Why? Then, shoulders like a man and hips like a woman. What is this for? Some here believe quite realistic humanoids would be generally a good idea, but it isn't. Every design decision needs to follow a use case. The only reason to build something quite human like are robowaifus. Workers don't need to look very human, at least can have wheels on their feet.

Obviously, for nothing good. It's plainly an artifact of identity-politics-swalloping """designers""" IMHO.

>Some here believe quite realistic humanoids would be generally a good idea, but it isn't. 
Define good.

>Every design decision needs to follow a use case. 
Certainly for businesses I would agree with this demand. Thankfully, we here on /robowaifu/ can be quite cavalier in our design approaches and still produce satisfying results for large audience segments I'd say.

>The only reason to build something quite human like are robowaifus. 
Perhaps so, perhaps not. Certainly it tends to serve our goals here, as you indicate.

>Workers don't need to look very human, at least can have wheels on their feet.
Fair enough. OTOH, designs like the humanoid androids on the ISS are designed that way (at great expense) for a specific reason. To wit (to quote Musk's writers); ''"WORLD BUILT BY HUMANS, FOR HUMANS"''.

>Looks like vapor-ware to me. Or a tech demo, research project, or a because we can project.

Personally I like this guy (Thunderfoot). He does proper science, presents evidence for his claims and often makes relevant points known. I found the whole process of designing and building an animatronic rather sobering myself. In that it gave me a glimpse into just how fukken difficult and expensive humanoid robotics is. Very difficult... but not impossible! 

Given Musk's deep pockets and network of competent engineers and programmers, I am really hoping they can build just a half-body (head, torso and arms) Tesla bot. But the whole mime routine...coupled with past debacles like Hyperloop and Solar City are...worrying.

Oh it's definitely time in the history of tech. They have the money, the talent, the technical infrastructure is there (cars, space), and the untapped market will be like a floodgate opening once people 'get it'.

If they are (((allowed))) to proceed unrestrained with this, I predict Tesla Bot will turn into a trillion-dollar market for them within ten to fifteen years, far outstripping all their other interests.

Especially companies from Japan and Korea seem to have movedaway from developing humanoids for everything, towards robots that are more specialized. I like the idea of the one hanging from the kitchen ceiling.

>To wit (to quote Musk's writers); "WORLD BUILT BY HUMANS, FOR HUMANS".
Even if robots in the workforce might have vaguely a human form and size, they don't need to look as human as the Teslas model. Though, I realized they don't want to use wheels to keep them slow.

also i wish the tweet (pic rel) he flashed for a frame is his main motivation as it would make him based. honestly it's the only real reason to make it look so humanoid beyond him just pushing the same old useless vaporwave. over all, maybe a half bot would be good enough. i can't imagine how useful it would be for factory work that a robot arm can't do, but it would be better than nothing. or again, maybe musk is secretly gunning at the robot waifu market

People will purchase a product if it makes their lives easier and more convenient. I have noticed over the past couple years those electric mini-scooters becoming a lot more ubiquitous. Because they mean people don't have to walk relatively short distances and the scooters are faster. If such a product will sell to people who can't be bothered to walk a few blocks...then why shouldn't robot waifus also sell? One could argue that they are designed to help reduce far more profound problems in society such as loneliness, depression and jealousy - all huge problems that make a lot of people's lives harder (even if they won't admit it). 

Also I have lost count what iPhone version we are now. 12XS? 13FU? Smartphones are still amazing technology, but at iteration 13 of the flagship version I think we are overdue for the next truly revolutionary product in the tech industry. 

Personally, I don't care that much if the first robot waifus come from big tech and need a bunch of mods/cracks and jailbreaking before they are truly "ours". By this stage that struggle is expected, and will only make the eventual freeing/unshackling our robowaifus that much more rewarding!

# 277
>>12676
Your picrel is what I had in mind as one example, thanks. No one will 'go' for the 'robowaifu market', bc it would mean risk of plenty of PR desasters to happen while not knowing how to make a lot of money from it. People in it for the money should do something else: Expensive to produce product, which would be quite to very complex, open source competition, a product in an area with plenty of possible variations in design without knowing what will be successful, chance of media backlash and government regulations, competing against women on their own turf, social and cultural hurdles, looming stigma of sex work and porn, same for misogyny or being related to rape and slavery, maybe getting linked to pedophilia and zoophilia on top of it, ...
This Tesla bot thing is probably only about patents and to keep the buzz going. It might be PR or vaporware, or it might be about building servants for martian hotels in Muskville, Mars.
Btw, Lex Fridman mentioned the problem about making money with humanoid robots in some if his podcast. Don't remember which one though. He's involved in autonomous cars and I think I remember he said, that he would like to get into humanoid robots, maybe with his own company, but talked to people which all would like to do it but don't see how to make money of it.

>(even if they won't admit it). 
< digits.
During Tesla's AI hiring event, during the Q&A following the presentations, one of the last questions as was about Tesla Bot and the man basically wanted to know if Tesla had any designs on people using them for emotional or companionship reasons. Elon Musk responded with his typical autistic (but laid-back) humor and plainly acknowledged that while no, they were making them to take care of boring, repetitive, and dangerous work, that yes, people might want them as a 'buddy' and made a smirk that they'd probably do all sorts of """creative""" things with them.

I personally want to believe that Musk has regularly browsed /robowaifu/, or at least has some flunkies somewhere doing so. I'm quite confident in fact after watching the presentation.

# 279
>>12677

Just to clarify, I only meant that Tesla should build something like Handle. I'm still pro robowaifus, still like your work SophieDev, still developing my own robowaifu.
>pr disaster 
Good point, that'll help keep the waifus in our hands. 
To keep things on topic, robots are now packing apples. It could be a selling point if we can get waifus to pick fruit.

# 280
>>12684
>get waifus to pick fruit
Again, they wouldn't be specialized for that. If you would build a robot picking fruit, you would want to give it more battery power than we have space, for example. You are even the one which wants them as light as possible. 
I once thought about a later side project. Building cheap farming bots for farmers in sunny countries to make them have fewer children and use robots with solar cells on their shell as help instead. Would be quite functional ones, though. Though, robots for bigger farms are something other people are already working on. We can only fill a niche with robowaifus and maybe some other niches with other robots, but we can't compete with every industrial or agricultural robot engineer. So far we're even not getting ahead very fast on our own turf, tbh.

>The Australian government has been moving towards a surveillance state for some years already. Now they are putting the nail in the coffin with an unprecedented surveillance bill that allows the police to hack your device, collect or delete your data, and take over your social media accounts; without sufficient safeguards to prevent abuse of these new powers.



>The Surveillance Legislation Amendment (Identify and Disrupt) Bill 2020 gives the Australian Federal Police (AFP) and the Australian Criminal Intelligence Commission (ACIC) three new powers for dealing with online crime:

>1. Data disruption warrant: gives the police the ability to "disrupt data" by modifying, copying, adding, or deleting it.

>2. Network activity warrant: allows the police to collect intelligence from devices or networks that are used, or likely to be used, by those subject to the warrant

>3. Account takeover warrant: allows the police to take control of an online account (e.g. social media) for the purposes of gathering information for an investigation.



>When presented with such warrant from the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, Australian companies, system administrators etc. must comply, and actively help the police to modify, add, copy, or delete the data of a person under investigation. Refusing to comply could have one end up in jail for up to ten years, according to the new bill.

I reckon the cost of running large neural networks will need to decrease before A.I. like GPT-3 becomes truly available to all. In the meantime, private corporations like ClosedAI can basically control every aspect. If your AI so much as flips a bit, they can close it down citing their arbitrary "policies". 

This is one reason I really want Fusion Power to succeed. Cheap power = cheap compute = fuck off private companies, we (and our robowaifus) can do what we like now.

TBH, IMO the entire ''statistical-salad word generator'' approach of __any__ of the autoregressive generators is basically flawed. They will likely '''never''' be well-suited to any common usage (probably by design). Better approaches must be devised that will effectively literally wrench power away from the Globohomo Big-Tech/Gov -- they obviously won't just give it up willingly.

But on the other hand if Fusion CAN "save the day", then we'll get hypercomputers, human and post-human level A.I, mass-produced advanced robots, seabed and asteroid mining, ethnic bioweapons and fusion bombs (if you look further into just a few of the theorised applications for Fusion energy you soon realise that it's just as likely to kill us all/get us replaced as "save us") It's like a choice between Mad Max or Bladerunner.

There's a lot of weird design choices. Why the ball-&-socket ankles, and also looks like ball-&-socket knees? That seems like it'd be both a nightmare for actuators or stability in general. The head is also pretty weird, with the proportions looking totally out of whack. It should be based on a figurine or at least a model ripped from a PSP game, if not the Switch game. The eyes at least look like they're big enough that they could easily house some cameras, but they look way too far apart. It's kinda sad that he just gave-up at the hands.

Looks like not much thought was put into the overall design and most of those papers are actually random garbage that has nothing to do with the design in the floor. 

Its also very top heavy. Without that stick, its going to crash into the floor. Guaranteed. Those legs look like hollow dead weight with nothing connecting them but some joints at the bottom of the pelvis.

What the hell is the third picture? Why waste time swapping out her torso components when you could put a sufficiently loud speaker in her head behind her mouth anyway. Her character is a singer, not a boombox and its acceptable to make solid hair like on anime figures.

I wouldn't say that. There are videos on his twitter showing it in motion, but nothing terribly impressive.

>most of those papers are actually random garbage that has nothing to do with the design in the floor. 
That seems to be the case, but the papers on the wall actually show the body parts. I don't really get the point of any of it except for posing for the photo.

>Its also very top heavy. Without that stick, its going to crash into the floor. Guaranteed. Those legs look like hollow dead weight with nothing connecting them but some joints at the bottom of the pelvis.
I don't think he has any plans to make it walk. It just gestures with the upper body and sings. If I were going to do that I would have at least tried to minimize the noise made by the actuators in the chest by having cables or hydraulics that go through the support rod and are powered/controlled somewhere else.

>What the hell is the third picture? Why waste time swapping out her torso components when you could put a sufficiently loud speaker in her head behind her mouth anyway. Her character is a singer, not a boombox and its acceptable to make solid hair like on anime figures.
I think he doesn't care if the sound comes out the chest because it's going to be covered by a shirt anyway. I think he was trying to keep the mouth flapping from messing with the sound of the speaker.

 I like that he used a piston design commonly seen in older sci fi for the neck but did not see her be able to turn her head. Though she can tilt her head.

>I think he was trying to keep the mouth flapping from messing with the sound of the speaker.

 She can wirelessly connect to similar speakers and computers anyway like he demonstrates. Still looks bad from a design perspective.

Artists now on permanent holiday.



Again OpenAI won't release their code or model because it's 'too dangerous', but it's based off GLIDE which already has code released:

https://github.com/openai/glide-text2im.git

>Specifically, we modify the 3.5 billion parameter GLIDE model by projecting and adding CLIP embeddings to the existing timestep embedding, and by projecting CLIP embeddings into four extra tokens of context that are concatenated to the sequence of outputs from the GLIDE text encoder.

Yes, four extra tokens too dangerous. Do you have a loicense for those tokens? '''[SIGINT]'''

Anyway I see this playing out like GPT-3. Technically you can generate articles indistinguishable from a human being at a glance, but only the technocrats and highest bidders are allowed access to benefit off it. The real significance of this paper to me is demonstrating the power of multimodal embeddings. This could be the key towards creating much more intelligent, smaller models that can run on microcontrollers.

If that gif is accurately portraying non-cherry-picked exemplars, then that's quite impressive IMO. I wonder how many US$100's of millions of hardware is used to back it? How many Watts were used in the training? The runtime usage?

Enquiring minds want to know! :^)

Haven't read the full paper but it's good to see GLUs are finally getting the recognition they deserve. I've found not using biases in dense layers and convolutions is useful because a lot of the time the network will zero out the weights and try to do all the work through the biases causing them to throw away a shit ton of work and get stuck in local minima, which causes huge instability in GANs in particular. On the other hand though there are problems that can only be solved by using biases. Turning them all off is better in general but I think it's a bit naive and they didn't investigate where turning them off was better because the model was too expensive to train.



Sharing the key/value projections between heads seems really useful to speed up inference on CPUs. RoPE embeddings improve training on smaller models too. The Pathways system and other improvements seem to only apply to their training accelerators. I was hoping it was an architecture improvement but it's just more haha matrix multiplication go brrrr.



>>15801

The two TPU pods they trained it on use 8 kWh each and cost $2-3 million per year each and I estimate they trained the biggest one for about 4 months, so about $1.5 million. They only give cherry-picked examples except for their 62B model. The paper seems mainly focused on performance rather than developing new understanding.

Thanks for the estimate Anon. So, apparently Nvidia won't even sell them, but leased only? I'm sure their government contracts probably are stipulated differently wouldn't you imagine?

I do not doubt that this individual or even some of their team have lurked here or even been contributors. I realize I was being paranoid of this and possible disruptors to this board, seeing us as a useful think-tank to glean ideas from but making sure to keep us a little off-balance and disorganized so we do not become a threat. This company also has patent pending on their current line of "Lily Mini" catgirl model. While they claim to be open source, this will be a minefield to navigate if such a group is always one step ahead of us and patenting their processes. So far they have a 1.5-2k price point moe-sized 3d printed plastic waifu with attachable (how do I say this tactfully?) - onahole, mouth and varying sexual "positions". That aside, it can verbally converse at a level equal or exceeding Replika.AI, possibly running on GPT3 already.

>>15857

It could also go the other way around, we can glean ideas from them instead.  I welcome for-profit endeavors as they tend to be more dedicated in producing results (compared to hobbyists who could procrastinate forever).



Just like I keep looking at A_says_ and hamcat_mqq and other Japanese devs to see the general direction they are moving in, I welcome looking at this and hopefully other small companies.  Unlike Boston Dynamics and other elite manufacturers, these guys' levels are still attainable to us.



Now whether we should fear being "out-patented", I'm sure best practices will always be open to implementation by all.  Just like Apple was unable to hold a monopoly on the capacitive touchscreen smartphone form factor, the concept of modular robot parts is already a given.

# 317
>>15857

The AI isn't really that good. You can get the same performance naively finetuning GPT-2. Even in this cherry-picked video she hallucinates by assuming she can cook dinners. It might seem cute but this is a common failure mode of language models.



I wouldn't take patenting as malicious. Raspberry Pi has tons of patents and proprietary code to boot up but the rest is open source and competitors are free to create their own boards. If you don't patent stuff you're bound to get copycats and knockoffs that don't make any effort to innovate and are just there to profit off your hard work that you're trying to make a living from and stay in business.



Personally I release my code so that anyone who wants to modify it and profit off it can. The purpose of sharing it is to fertilize the field so other people can grow the crops since I can't grow them all myself. I still have to buy the crops I helped fertilize but at least there is a variety and something else to buy. That's my mentality. If anyone really saw us as a useful think-tank I doubt they would shit where they eat. Maybe if we were directly cutting into someone's business then it would be a different story, but even then there are plenty of open-source projects people are making a killing from, such as Spleeter and neural style transfer because the average person doesn't know how to do this stuff and rather pay someone to do it.

# 318
>>15862



Anon, I would like to ask a question if I may. Would you be able to provide me with a tutorial to finetune GPT-2? Preferably with the one that has the highest parameters (the biggest one that we can reach). Secondly, I would like to know if it's possible to train the GPT-2 model for other languages as well. If so, how good hardware and how much would one need to train a proper model?

# 319
>>15877

Properly fine-tuning language models to a desired purpose requires a lot of knowledge, data and custom code unless you just want to fool around throwing something in the same way as pretraining data and seeing what it spits out. There are plenty of tutorials for that around the web.



The training scripts and tutorials I've seen HuggingFace and other libraries provide for generative finetuning are extremely memory inefficient for any serious use beyond toy datasets. You want to tokenize your dataset first and then read the tokens from disk, not generating them all at run-time.



The biggest model you can train depends on a lot of factors. You're not gonna get very far without a 12 GB GPU but you can finetune GPT-2 medium (375M parameters) with 6 GB using some tricks such as pre-tokenizing the dataset, gradient checkpointing, automated mixed precision, using a smaller context/block size (256 is good enough for conversation, 512 for responding to posts), or using SGD or RMSprop in place of AdamW but I recommend using AdamW unless you're absolutely unable to get things to fit in memory.



Even with all these tricks you'll only be able to handle a batch size of 1, so you need to use gradient accumulation. If you want fast convergence start with 32 accumulation steps and double it each time training plateaus or the loss becomes too noisy, up to 512. If you want the best possible results, start with 512 or higher. The quality will be just as good as training it with 512 GPUs just 512x slower. The extra time isn't a big deal for finetuning since convergence happens quickly compared to training from scratch.



People have had success transfer learning GPT-2 to other languages and made their models available. If you want a multilingual model I'm not aware of any and doubt their quality since it requires an immense amount of memory to model just one language. You could try making a multilingual one but the quality likely isn't going to be very good and will require a larger vocab size and thus larger memory requirements to train.



What purpose are you going to use the model for? You should have something specific in mind, such as providing knowledge from books, brainstorming, critically examining ideas, listening, joking around. Make a list of everything you want it to do, then figure out what data you need to learn each task and the objectives to train on. For example, if you feed in a lot of questions, you probably don't care about the model being able to correctly generate lists of similar questions. You're only interested in how well it can respond to those questions, so labels should only be provided for the answers, rather than doing more generative pretraining that only learns to mimic text.

All I'm reading here is that it's impossible to leverage AI for our purposes unless you're willing to take out a 20 year loan for GPUs.

# 321
>>15884

Don't worry RiCOdev, training AI is difficult but, running them is much easier. For example, you'd want a beefy GPU with many GB's of RAM to train an AI that processes camera images to find key  elements but, you could deploy said AI low power hardware. Jevois is a good example of a low cost low power device that would run the model created by much stronger hardware. http://www.jevois.org/

The other Anon was talking about how difficult it is to work with GPT-2. They also bring up the very important part where you need to define what the AI is used for. I would add that you need to figure out the target hardware both for training and implementation, it can make a big difference in the AI you choose. Other Anons please feel free to clarify and correct me.

# 322
>>15884

We can leverage existing models by finetuning them but pretraining older models from scratch, like vanilla GPT-2, is out of the question. Finetuning just means to continue training a pretrained model on a new dataset, leveraging what it learned from the pretraining dataset.



There are newer language models that can be trained from scratch on low-end hardware. IDSIA's fast weight programmer model trains blazing fast on my toaster GPU but I have neither the space required to pretrain a complete model on the Pile dataset which is 800 GB or the free resources since I have other stuff training. So I prefer using Nvidia's Megatron-LM which is only 375M parameters but performs nearly as good as GPT-2 XL with 1.5B.



If you only have a tiny GPU to train on, IDSIA's recurrent FWP model is the way to go. Their 44M parameter configuration performs nearly as well as GPT-2 medium (375M) and outperforms GPT-2 small (117M), while training a few orders of magnitude faster and having a virtually infinite context window length because it doesn't use the insane O(n^2) dot product attention that eats up so much memory.



There are also other methods to training deep language models even faster like ReZero: https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.04887

Algorithmic efficiency doubles roughly every 16 months, so a lot of the difficulty we have today will disappear in 2-4 years time. Hopefully by then people will have pretrained good models we already have like RFWP and brought them into mainstream use.



And like Kiwi said you don't need to have a beefy GPU to use them. The minimum requirement to use GPT-2 medium's full context size is 3 GB. With half the context size it probably only needs around 1-2 GB. And 12 GB GPUs are only $500 today which is what I paid for a 6 GB one 3 years ago.



>>15885

>I would add that you need to figure out the target hardware both for training and implementation

Definitely, GPT-2 is going to be difficult to run off a SBC or deploy in games or a virtual waifu app. People forget that LSTMs perform just as well as transformers and run faster on CPUs, but didn't receive much attention since they couldn't be trained easily on GPU farms. With RFWP they took the advantages of both LSTMs and transformers so they can be trained on GPUs but also deployed for use on low-power mobile CPUs.

A really interesting paper dropped a couple months ago on differentiable search indexes with promising results: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.06991.pdf



Essentially you train a seq-to-seq transformer on a set of documents to predict which document ids a query matches without having to do any extra steps like a k nearest neighbour search or a maximal inner product. They found that semantic ids, where the ids represent document contents somewhat, worked best and they implemented these by using a hierarchical structure, sort of like tagging a book or article in a library by subject, topic, subtopic, publication title, date, author, article title and page number, but generated these clusters automatically via another model. Even a small search model (250M parameters) greatly outperformed a standard algorithmic approach and it can be continuously updated with new documents via finetuning.



This is a huge development towards building effective memory controllers and language models capable of doing continual learning. You could attach semantic ids to memories and store them for retrieval later so a chatbot can remember the name of your dog, your birthday, past conversations, any specific books or documents it trained on, any random post on the internet in its dataset, and anything else. It will be able remember everything, bring those relevant memories into its generation context and give a proper reply. The possibilities of what could be done with this are mind boggling.



Once I finish what I'm working on I'm going to implement a proof of concept. This is surely going to revive people's interest in chatbots and robowaifus once they're capable of learning and evolving, and not only that but accurately retrieving information on any topic, researching topics for you, answering programming questions, suggesting good recipes from your fridge and cupboard contents, making anime and game recommendations, reporting any news you might find interesting, and so much more that people in the 2000s dreamed chatbots would do. We're basically on track to the prediction I made that by 2022 AI companions will start becoming commonplace, which will hopefully translate into a surge of new devs and progress. What a time to be alive!

# 325

> any random post on the internet in its dataset
Now I don't know about 'any', but I have over 60 IBs completely archived in my ''BUMP'' archives going back about 2.5 years now. And for the upcoming ''Bumpmaster/Waifusearch'' fused-combo, if you think it would be valuable & feasible, then I would welcome input on adapting ''Waifusearch'' & the post's internal tagging system to meet your needs with this.

Just let me know if you think it's something worth our time, Anon.

# 326

Tags for posts would certainly help with fine-tuning but the JSON data should be enough. I just need access to download posts from the old board. It'd be a good warmup project to create a neural search engine since I know the posts so well and could verify how well it's working. Then that could be expanded into a bot that can answer questions and bring up related posts that have fallen out of memory.



For example, going back to knowledge graphs: >>15318

With DSI the memory reading part is set and done. It needs to be tested if memories can be written a similar way. One idea I have is if it tries to stuff memories into an existing semantic id that holds memory data already, the two could be combined and summarized, allowing it to add and refine information like an internal wiki. All the relations learned would be stored in natural language rather than in a graph. And an additional loss could be added to penalize long memories by using a continuous relaxation to keep the loss fully differentiable: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.05651.pdf



Fitting all the relevant memories found into the context will be a problem but IDSIA's RFWP model might shine through here or perhaps taking inspiration from prefix tuning to summarize retrieved memories into an embedding prefix. It might be a lot more efficient actually to store memories as embeddings rather than in natural language but harder to debug. And the DSI model, memory summarizing and prefix generation for all this could all be handled by the same T5 model since it's a multi-task model.



Man it's gonna be crazy if this actually works. My head is exploding with ideas.

# 327
>>15923
>but the JSON data should be enough
Alright, you'll have it. R/n it's a hodgepodge collection, but I was gonna have to organize to prep for the new ''Waifusearch'' to search across them all anyway. Expect something soon**-ish**. I post links in the ''AI Datasets'' thread when it's ready Anon (>>2300).

>I just need access to download posts from the old board. It'd be a good warmup project to create a neural search engine since I know the posts so well and could verify how well it's working. 
That would indeed be great, but without going into a tl;dr the simple, sad, fact is we lost several important threads' full-content. If you have exact specific threads you want, I'll sift the emergency filepile that occurred and see if its there. Hopefully most of what you want survived somehow.

>All the relations learned would be stored in natural language rather than in a graph.
This would indeed be easier to debug, but certainly would be less efficient than hash bins or some other encoding mechanism. Maybe both? At least for the dev/prototyping?

>Man it's gonna be crazy if this actually works. My head is exploding with ideas.

Anon, if you can find the time, I'd like to ask you to have a read of this blog post (it's one of the primary men behind Gemini protocol).
https://portal.mozz.us/gemini/gemini.circumlunar.space/users/solderpunk/gemlog/low-budget-p2p-content-distribution-with-git.gmi

His position in the post is that textual-based material should be distributed for consumption via Git. For a lot of different reasons. His positions seem pretty compelling to me, but I'd like other Anons viewpoints on this.

And this isn't simply a casual interest either. Since I'm going to be doing a big dump of JSON files for you, why couldn't we use his approach and publish them via a repo? AFAICT, I could automate pushing new JSON content as BUMP/Bumpmaster grabs them. And anyone such as yourself or ''Waifusearch'' users can just do a git pull to be updated quickly with just the new changes. 

Does this make sense, or am I missing something?

Pretty impressive if true. It seems they only made it available to be used with their own software though instead of sharing how it works. I'm guessing splitting images into patches allows them to use a model with fewer layers.

# 335
>>15955
Thanks Kywy for bringing it to everyone's attention.

Seems like they are going for the industrial/assembly-line target audience with it. They particularly state that their system works best with small, separated items. Now 'small' is a direct artifact of the camera's placement & intrinsic lens settings, etc., but they are pretty upfront about what they mean (as with the example images). QA stuff for manufacturing, food-processing, etc.

That's not to say their approach is invalid for our vastly more-complex visual computing problems, however. Most innovations in this and other fields start small and grow big. It's the way of the Inventor heh.

>>15957
>Pretty impressive if true.
Indeed. 

I would much prefer their algorithms were freely available to all of us ofc, but it's understandable. But one thing I'd note is the grid-approach is perfectly amenable to even the smallest of GPUs for acceleration purposes. Even the Raspberry Pi has one as part of the basic phone chipset it's derived from.

I expect that if they are already doing it, then other Anons with a mind for open-sauce software will follow suit before long. Maybe it could be some kind of an 'auxiliary mode' or something where sorting small items comes into play for our robowaifus?
