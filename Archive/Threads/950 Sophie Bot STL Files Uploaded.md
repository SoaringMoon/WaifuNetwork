I need to sort out her CAD files more before uploading them, but the .STLs are ready.

Thanks OP. Sophie is cute. I haven't checked yet curious what program you used to slice the files? I have Cura on my box.

I use Cura as my slicer as well. Oh, and I've uploaded the .f3d files now, too.

But can it walk?

No, she's unpowered. This one is just a dolly on a trolley (currently positioned next to one of my CCTV security cameras due to her ability to often freak people out at night). Sophie v1 learned me a lot about 3D printing and joint making. I plan to use some of the CAD and what I've learned building her as the basis for a more advanced doll in the future.

do you plan on reducing the elbow number in the future?
was the durability the main concern for the decision to make 2 elbows? 
if yes, is it possible to print the "bones" in 2 halves, with some space in it for a metal rod and then gluing it all together?

Hi, I'm not SophieAnon. But if you need a simple design which could do that I probably could and would create that. Might be easier to print if cut in the middle anyways. I'm not sure if I could design the screws, though. Just draw it with some measurements, and have a little patience. Alternativly, look into learning Solvespace yourself, which needs much less computing power than Fusion360.
Please also take into consideration that the strength of prints dependent on their orientation when printed. The layers should be along the direction where the most force is applied (which doesn't work for printed screws).

Reason I gave her two elbows was for flexibility. Originally she only had one revolute joint at the elbow, but this greatly limited her range of movement. So I decided to make her arms double-jointed instead!

These parts are actually really durable (particularly her upper arms). I remember trying to force together sections that I hadn't quite measured properly, and I was surprised at how solid they were. I could only snap them by literally standing on the overhang of a joint. 

In future, I want to make a similar joint system to this, but scaled down a bit (so she doesn't end up with bodybuilder arms) and with in-built channels or clips that allow flexible piping to run along the limb. Then I can pipe warm water along the limb (Not too hot though! Around 40 degrees celsius should do. Don't want to melt the 3D prints LOL!) 

Adding a soft silicone layer over the top of that will be quite tricky though. Probably have to mold it in small sections and leave significant gaps around each joint. 

I would make a test limb first, with no hand. Just to try and get the pipes fitted and the pump system working along a flexible armature. Then experiment with different 3d-printed silicone molds using that CAD as a starting point.

Still more of a sexdoll than a robowaifu, I know. But if it's warm and huggable and cute then that'll do me :D

>The layers should be along the direction where the most force is applied
Interesting. Mind providing a sketch or image that clarifies this a bit for everyone anon? 'Along the direction' isn't perfectly clear to me yet. Does that mean 'build up layers in '''opposition''' to the line of force' (so, probably the word I'd choose would be ''orthogonally'' to). Or does it mean 'align the seams of the layers '''along''' the line of force' (again, the word I'd choose would probably be ''tangentially'' to)? 

BTW, would you mind also explaining the engineering rationale behind the recommended choice, whichever it is? TIA.

Had a bit of a brainstorming session. I think kit along the lines of image attached would allow me to produce a warm water heating loop for my doll/robowaifu. 

Basically need to pump in 4-5 litres of hot tap water from a bucket or other container into the storage heater tank (could also just pour it in via a funnel). This then further heats and holds the water at a steady 45 degrees celsius before being pumped via solenoid through a flexible piping system that runs along the limbs and body of my robowaifu. The pipe(s) could then run back to the original input bucket/container of hot tap water and the process repeats in a loop.

I already know how to do articulated limbs. Next I need to make limbs that are both flexible/posable and warm to the touch.

Sorry for the lacking explanation and late answer. It can be explained rather simple: An arm is longer then wide, also the force of lifting something should be dispensed through the whole length. So don't print it standing and also make the printhead move along the length of the arm while printing. Don't know how to call that, only had an "E" in maths and this was long time ago. There are plenty of videos on print orientation available on YouTube. We also have a section here >>94 where this certainly came up at least once.

>>12577
Thats excellent.

That is really cool SophieDev, and your usual shopping-list montages are always appreciated. I look forward to seeing your solutions to this design issue if you tackle it.
