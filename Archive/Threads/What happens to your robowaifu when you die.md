Have any of you considered what will happen to your waifu after you die? How would you prepare her to face the world alone? Will she even be able to take care of her own needs when you're gone?

Have you considered the possibility that she might be so unwilling to let you die that you'll wake up in a robot body yourself one day? Would you resent her for not allowing you to die?

There is a great short hentai mango that addresses this topic of a beloved master dying on his long-lived robowaifu exactly. Post it here if you'd like OP. (Spoiler it ofc)

>that you'll wake up in a robot body yourself one day?
Explain how that would happen please? Remember this isn't a science-fiction board, but an engineering board. Please provide a rational mechanism that would actually work IRL, not the fanciful hogwash that the likes of Kurzweil promote.

And even if it was a reality by some miracle, that your human soul could be placed inside a machine, it would be an evil abomination. The globohomo kike's transhumanism vision for the world is certainly not something this board is promoting nor would it support.

And finally, the deviant sexuality of ''"I want to be the little girl"'' is m00t-tier shit. I'll ban you for promoting any such literal faggotry outside of The Lounge. >>39 Take it there if that's your agenda here anon.

Not the same anon, but could you drop the title of said manga?

Sorry anon, I don't remember I saw it years ago. It's only 5 or 6 pages IIRC.

I posted this in the general thread not seeing that this exists.

Honestly I'd just tell her to round up the other lost waifus of the world and form a waifu mafia that will end up taking over an entire city and running crime rings until they begin interfering with world politics.

No idea if that would happen but it'd be pretty interesting nonetheless.

You brought up an interesting point this the Meta thread about abandoned robowaifus going on the run (and perhaps banding together).

Ever see the movie ''AI'' by Spielberg? It actually kind of touches on this in a sidelong manner, and in a very dystopic way at least for the robowaifus. You might check that out.

Anyway, I like the approach used in ''The Bicentennial Man'' alot better; Namely, they become a beloved and valuable family heirloom and are passed from generation to generation. Maybe something like that for your robowaifu when you're gone Anon?

>Namely, they become a beloved and valuable family heirloom and are passed from generation to generation. Maybe something like that for your robowaifu when you're gone Anon?
Well unless she can somehow reproduce I'm probably not passing her on to anyone. And even if I could, would my son really want to take his mom as a waifu? Hahahahahahaha you know maybe he would I'm not sure I'm laughing so fucking hard ffs

That's even funnier than a damn robot waifu mafia collective

# 8
>>1532
Oh, and BTW the ''other'' dystopic outcome is pretty much brought up in every ''Artificial'' movie ever, from the ''Blade Runners'' to ''Chappie''. I think that ''The Animatrix'' and the ''Terminators'' are also ones along these lines.

Personally, I look forward to a more peaceful future together for anon and his robowaifus tbh.

I'll just smash her to pieces if I know I'm gonna die. Or have her self destruct when machines cant detect my vital signs no more. I'm not gonna let my bot get passed around and raped by normalniggers, because that is exactly what they would do.

# 16
She will go on caring for our children. At some point her road would end. I thought about it, we need some artificial afterlife for them, including a simulation of their former master. Other people will still be able to contact them.
For that we will need a network of trustworthy foundations which run servers and protect private data, and also some other people joining in. They can mine money that way, to pay for their relatives or for their own "upload" later.

However, before we have them to be some form of AI this is not relevant. Let's focus on other things

This is a charming notion. And I don't see any reason a robowaifu couldn't just go on 'living' indefinitely with proper maintenance. Certainly for a few hundred years seems reasonable to me. For a good pop-culture take on this notion, watch the film ''Bicentennial Man'' starring a robot Robin Williams.

That's probably best ATM Anon.

# 18
>>829
>Have any of you considered what will happen to your waifu after you die?
I'd hope that I'd be able to teach her to repair and alter herself. When I'm gone and she remains, I hope she changes out her appearance, upgrades to a newer body, and becomes as real a person as she can. Eventually, she'll have to reset her memory and give herself a fresh start. Maybe around every 75 years or so, but generally just whenever she is ready.

sort of what would happen to the elf girl in LotR if Aragorn married her and died
your robowaifu mourns you for eternity and stays by your side
basically, she becomes your gravestone

The robowaifu could become like a protector of the current living family members, that is assuming there are artifical wombs and or you adopted some kids. If you did not have kids i'm not sure what would be the best thing to program it to do if you care about being ethical.

# 25
I'm going to teach her how things die and change, starting with her battery running out and the leaves in the fall, and eventually myself and her on a much longer time scale so she understands our time is precious. Even if she can possibly reload her data into a new body, I don't want her to take that for granted. A powerful enough solar flare could wipe out most electronics on earth or the future could become a terrible war. All I can do is give my best every day towards creating a bright and lively future for her and open up a path for the energy I imbued her with. If governments still exist in the future they will likely toss people's robowaifus in the scrap yard, so I'm planning on entrusting a friend to look after her and making sure she's capable of maintaining herself.

I don't know when I'll die either. For all I know it could be tomorrow before I create a body for her. So I will try to teach her how to speak every sentence as though they are her last words, so she has no uncertainty of death and how soon today will be over.

that would be the ideal situation actually. That my robowaifu would be so heartbroken she would work tirelessly to ressurect me as an AI with eternal life. Then we would build our starship/space ark together

Funny you should say that anon! I am building a place called "Seraphim City" on Cities Skylines. It is supposed to have a solarpunk/utopian aesthetic and it includes a structure called "Cathedral of the Robowaifus". Except instead of burning incense and praying I reckon that mostly programming and overclocking goes on in there. But there is a huge electronic synth-organ and a Vocaloid robot choir that sings to mark special occasions.

Don't know what you mean by campy, but Apple is one of the best Robowaifus in media, and the full movie to that short is also really great. I like it when they're quirky, bc them being machines, but the story isn't about telling how bad it would be to have them.

Do you have evidence for this? Granted, I wouldn't want it either, as the human soul is the ultimate, like anything else, and should be free to go beyond.

>And finally, the deviant sexuality of "I want to be the little girl" is m00t-tier shit.
I don't think OP mentioned that. Also, as an aside, how would it be sexual if the person never engaged in intercourse? I think the matter of mind-transferring at all would be a bigger issue than what age the vessel appeared to possess.

Expiration date? Why? Their purpose could end with their masters life, so they would shutdown permanently. Or take care of the children, till they get old and shut down for good after a good bye ceremony.

>>And finally, the deviant sexuality of "I want to be the little girl" is m00t-tier shit.
Agreed b/c it's a regression to infantilism and self-objectification, this stems from psychological issues that need to be worked out
However being reborn as the ultimate chad bishonen (Like Sephiroth or Adam/Eve) is perfectly ok ; )

# 45
>>12150
Honestly, I think some sort of non-bodily transcendence to [insert favored God-concept here] would ultimately be more fruitful, though a period of immanent divinity is not objectionable, I suppose. I just don't really see how regression to the childhood state is more degenerate than the objectification of a partner.

I'll have her set her on/off switch to off. Rather than try to make me into a robot, I'd rather she figured out how to make me immortal but still human.

I see three distinct options:

I don't know what I will do. When the time comes and I must make a choice.
