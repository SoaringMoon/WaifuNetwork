Hi anons!
After looking at the introductory comment in
>>2701
which mentions the use of the MIT licence for robowaifu projects. I read the terms:
https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT
Seems fine to me, however I've also been considering the 3-clause BSD licence:
https://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause
>>4432

The reason I liked this BSD licence is the endorsement by using the creator's name (3rd clause) must be done by asking permission first. I like that term as it allows me to decide if I should endorse a derivative or not.

Do you think that's a valid concern?

Initially I also thought that BSD has the advantage of forcing to retain the copyright notice, however MIT seems to do that too.
It has been mentioned that MIT is already used and planned to be used. How would the these two licences interplay with each other?

Can I get a similar term applied from BSD's third clause but with MIT?

I made this thread to discuss different open source licences and see the dis/advantages of each. I haven't mentioned GPL due to the requirement of forcing the derivative work to be published.

>>4451
Mind giving us a breakdown of the third clause in BSD in your own words OP? Maybe it will help answering your question.

>>4457
That's the idea. You're quite free to make a derivative of our works, and re-license it as your own proprietary work Anon. No one here will stop you.

In the meantime using this ''cuck'' license will help spread robowaifu tech far and wide which is the fundamental idea. The only ones who are ~~angered~~'harmed' by it are ideologues who want to run things for other people. The rest of us are free to make money with it, or give it away as we see fit.

# 4
>>4458
>3. Neither the name of the copyright holder nor the names of its contributors may be used to endorse or promote products derived from this software without specific prior written permission.

To me this means (in regards to my work) whoever produces derivative work must ask for my permission if my name is used in advertising the derivative work.

From what I understand with the MIT licence, my permission is not necessary for using my name when advertising derivative work, correct?

That's what I was unsure about. Even under a pseudonym, I wouldn't want my name on product advertisements that I don't support. This is specifically to do with advertising, my code could still be used with no issue.

You indirectly bring up the problem with being open source, botnet companies (I.e. Google and Facebook) couple build robowaifus pozzed to hell. They'd be perverting or creations into spying machines, they could even limit sexual interactions while demanding she doesn't treat her Anon as her with complete devotion. We wouldn't be able to complete either, they can spend more then us, get things made for less then us, all while selling at a loss at first to bury us. To defend our pure ideals of altruistic loving robowaifus, having patents are sadly important. If we can patent parts of her design to make it so that less caring, pozzed sjw companies can't touch her is something to consider. Of course, us Anons would share our parents amongst ourselves, while allowing anyone to build there own waifus. A shell company all of /robowaifu/ could be apart of with us collaborating to ensure the future of waifutbots, isn't a bad idea.

# 6
>>5879
Extremely good points anon. I'd like to give you a very thoughtful response if I can. But first I did an edit on you're post to help me clarify my own thinking. Can you look this over and see if you approve please?

………………………

You indirectly bring up the problem with being open source. Botnet companies (ie, Google and Facebook) could build robowaifus pozzed to hell. They'd be perverting our creations into spying machines. They could even limit sexual interactions while [corrupting her so] she doesn't treat her Anon as her master with complete devotion. We wouldn't be able to compete either, they can spend more then us, get things made for less then us, all while selling at a loss at first to bury us. 

To defend our pure ideals of altruistic, loving robowaifus [the necessity of] having patents is sadly important. If we can patent parts of her design to make it so that [evil,] uncaring, pozzed sjw companies can't touch her is something to consider. Of course, us Anons would share our patents amongst ourselves, while allowing anyone to build their own [personal] robowaifus. A shell company [owning] all of /robowaifu/ [IP assets] could be a part of us, collaborating [together with us] to [help] ensure the future of [free & open] waifubots. This isn't a bad idea.

>>5879
All these concerns have been addressed with the GPLv3 license.  Which is why most big tech companies avoid software under the GPLv3 like the plague.
You don't have to give up your property rights when you open source if you use the GPLv3 license.

Yes Anon, you understand my meaning perfectly. Thanks for correcting some of my spelling mistakes as well.

# 10
>>5881
I'm not sure if I understand this part. 
But, the license seems to make sure there can't be restrictions to access the software, like blocking the user from access it and then using laws to make it illegal to circumvent these blocks. https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html

>>4451
robo waifu's need to be libre and under the GPL-V3 or they're gay

# 13
>>10861
The problem with the restrictive GPL is that it prevents entrepreneurial anons from creating their own businesses using any of our material. The open licenses like BSD-3/MIT, and the restrictive licenses like GPL, aren't very compatible.

Since our actual agenda here is to spread robowaifu tech as far and wide as possible -- conceivably across the entire planet someday -- then the non-restrictive licenses are far superior to the others.

# 14
What about the Boost and Zlib licenses? I've heard they are both even less restrictive than either BSD-3 or MIT, while still protecting the authors.

# 15
>>10863
Programs can still call each other. One can create proprietary software which then calls software which is free (osc). If necessary, he can put APIs into the free software and make that public.
Also, I don't see why it would be impossible to use GPL files or software in a business.

# 16
>>10866
>Also, I don't see why it would be impossible to use GPL files or software in a business.
Because it prevents a company from keeping it's software secrets. The GPL 'infects' the codebase with it's restrictive license by requiring all other code in a codebase to be treated under it's license. Bad for business.

# 17
>>10867
Okay, I knew about that part. But it doesn't prevent a craftsman building robots based on GPL licenced files and software, for example. 
Then, programs should be modular anyways. I don't want to see some huge program without API, which one could use or not, but either way its one huge cluck of software.

# 18
>>10863
It prevents entrepeneurs from selling things made with our material, but I think it's worth it. With cuck licenses the noble ideal of complete freedom of anons is destroyed utterly by the kikery of the multi billion dollar corporations who will incorporate our material stealthily and use or repurpose it for nefarious purposes. See the guy that made the operating system that Intel used on their chips as a foundation on which now lays their (((Management Engine))). I think he used a BSD license and any good done by that is outweighed by the sheer reach and power of Intel.

# 19
>>10896
You can sell products with GPL licence. Just need to incorporate a link to the source code, or something like that.

# 20
>>10902
I'm aware you can sell products under the GPL. That's not the issue. The fact that if you ~~infect~~ include it into your codebase, it requires you to release __all__ your code as GPL, is the issue.

No thanks.

# 21
>>10903
Again, this only applies to the program under such GPL licence. Not all the software your are using on some project. And these programs can call each other. If you think of a WaifuOS then the programs it consists of could be licensed in different ways. There might be a restriction if you permanently link to a library, but for all I know this isn't the case if programs interact with each other via APIs, pipes, and such.

# 22
>>10911
>Not all the software your are using on some project.
No, it's all the software compiled together in a common codebase. Include even ''one'' GPL'd file in the mix and you are now legally bound across the entire collection by it. This is why corporations generally refuse to use the GPL. The term 'infect' the codebase is obviously intentional. 

And quite frankly, if the intention on our parts is to enable anons and others to spread robowaifus far and wide, then why is this even a consideration? The MIT & BSD-3 license have no such encumbrances. The entire philosophy behind the GPL is to strongarm companies, forcing them to release ''all'' their sourcecode.

I don't think that's /robowaifu/'s 'agenda', as it were, and I know it's certainly not mine. I __want__ companies to form up creating robowaifus. Them being able to keep their secrets will aid in that process. 

Case in point, cf. ''Em Elle E'' and his ''WaifuEngine'' project (>>10361). I'd be only too happy if he decided to use our code here from /robowaifu/, and he has clearly stated he hasn't any intention of open-sourcing his project. 

More power to him I say. After all, he __is__ creating a waifu project, and I think that's pretty cool.

# 23
>>10911
Very cool pic, btw. I don't think I've seen that one yet. Saved.

# 24
>>10912
No. You're again thinking in terms of one huge program. Just split it into more than one. Your argument only applies if it's one compilable program, but it won't make sense to do that anyways.

# 25
>>4451
Hi Anons, OP here, though on a different machine.
Since last year I've been working and learning a lot, and the question of licensing has become more relevant (I'm looking into business, although not robowaifus XD).
And so I actually went and read a range of different licenses:
Software
-GPLv3
-Apache 2.0
-BSD 3-Clause
-MIT (more specifically Expat, as MIT is too broad a term)
Hardware
-CERN Open Hardware License V2 - Weakly Reciprocal or CERN-OHL-W (BSD/Apache/MIT-like)
-TAPR Open Hardware License

By far not all of them, see SPDX IDs website for some of the standard ones available.
Bear in mind, I don't have a legal background, and some of these I skim-read (GPL was by far the longest at 11 sides printed).

From my research I've gathered the following:
- You need to consider whether the license is tailored for software or hardware. For example GPLv3 has wording that is much more applicable to software and software libraries than hardware (or hardware description blocks). Better choices might be CERN-OHL-S (if you want GPLv3-like license), or CERN-OHL-W or TAPR etc (BSD/Apache/MIT-like).

- Some allow linking to proprietary code/hardware, some don't.

- When releasing a GPL project, only the work itself needs to be released. Any additional libraries that are used to by the program, but are readily available (as part of an OS package etc.) do not need to be published. I think the main issue is when trying to "cram" all the code in a single binary is where the issues arise. Same goes for the tools required to compile/build your work.
You must however provide installation instructions so that the user could get everything working, but you do not need to distribute standard components. My reasoning comes from the definitions of "System Libraries", "Standard Interface", and "Corresponding Source" (sections 1, paragraph 2, 3, and 4).

-Keeping clear separation of works allows to use different licenses together. If the hardware is licensed under CERN-OHL-W, the license only covers the hardware (and not the software/firmware). There are also leeways when it comes to using proprietary components (such as integrated circuits) so long as they are available for purchase. 
As one of the anons mentioned, if a robo-waifu has an OS, the software running on that OS can be proprietary or differently licensed. GPL doesn't go beyond the boundaries of the project. Only when another project sufficiently relies on the functionality of the GPL project does the license start to apply (derivative works).
I much prefer the Unix/Posix idea of small, highly specialised programs that do one thing well (also simplify the licensing).

For the underlying system software I still think a strong license is better for security and personal freedom. However as for the hardware, weaker licenses are acceptable (as long as all components can be purchased). The application software can then be open or proprietary, depending on the type of user and the amount of support required by the user.

Please feel free to correct me on any of the points I made.

# 26
>>10919
Oh and forgot to mention, a lot of tools available today (for example OpenSSH from OpenBSD) are widely available and frequently used, likely because of their permissive nature.

It's difficult to make the judgement whether a weakly-permissive nature of BSD-like projects or copyleft Linux-like are better for the long-term (a different argument can be made in regards to companies). However I have noticed that anything critically important to mankind should be in the public domain and I'll probably release some of my projects like that once I deem them to be mature enough.

# 27
>>10919 >>10920
Thanks, very interesting. And good to know that /robowaifu/ inspires people to learn something related to it.
> when another project sufficiently relies on the functionality of the GPL project does the license start to apply (derivative works).
If I wrote a stand-alone / offline chatbot which would use different underlying programs, which are licensed in GPL, to parse graphs, fetching data, storing responses, etc and I would call these programs via Python or Linux pipes, do you think derivative works would apply? And would I have to release my own code as GPL? (sharing the code of the other programs or linking to it, isn't the issue here)

# 28
>>10921
While I was writing my wall of text, I was thinking about this very issue.
Here's a stackoverflow page where a dev asks about accessing GPL library via a server:
https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/50118/avoid-gpl-violation-by-moving-library-out-of-process

To me it seems to be this way: if your program is able to work stand-alone without the GPL code, then you may have flexibility in licensing. You're also not dynamically linking the programs, only using them as backends so-to-speak.

In my opinion (not a layer!) as long as you provide instructions for users to install your software and any dependencies, then you're probably safe from derivative work issue. Your chatbot is quite different from the graph parsing/data fetching that the libraries provide, right?

# 29
>>10919
Thanks for the detailed, thoughtful post OP. Quite helpful. I particularly like the fact you've taken the time to break out some of the hardware & software considerations. While I subscribe to the general concepts behind the ''Unix Philosophy'', I also realize that -- particularly in a hard-realtime embedded environment of a robowaifu, that such modular and clearly-demarcated software systems is neither efficient, nor economical, nor even ''practical'', by-and-large.

The real world often has a way of dictating terms to ''us humans'' like that, not the other way round heh. :^) This is certainly a very complicated problem, and fundamental constraints like functionality, performance, and cost must form the basics of our approaches if we hope to succeed at this. If we can manage all that and still utilize <insert Anon's favorite licensing & modular partitioning scheme here>, then all the better. 

It's definitely a complex topic, not one simply cut-and-dried.

Also, the term 
>''sufficiently''
-as in "...when another project sufficiently relies on the functionality..." raises a red-flag for me.
If you feel inclined, we could use a more clear specification regarding this term. 'More clear' as in; 'How do we protect ourselves from the inevitable attacks against us, that this vague term will be abused to accomplish?' .

I think licenses that are explicitly intended to free the IP to the extent humanly possible are by far our safest route here. To wit, the ones intended to grant the licensors themselves the greatest leeway possible. Namely, (BSD/Apache/MIT-like). Ones that take a leftist, ideologue type of approach to the topic, one intended to control everyone and everything around them, namely (GPL-like), are IMO much, much more likely to be used against us and to the detriment of the robowaifu movement overall.

I realize I'm quite biased here. I can assure you that it's not a casual choice either, for whatever that's worth. Remember, these lawyers are very ''definitely'' not our friends; they are much more likely to be used as tools and pawns, intended in their usage to subvert and destroy any open-source robowaifu movement. After all, just ask yourself -- who is paying these people anyway?

Also, would you care to spell out in further detail the terms 'strong license' and 'weaker license' if you would please?

Again, thanks for the work and helping everyone understand things better.

# 30
>>10931
>I particularly like the fact you've taken the time to break out some of the hardware & software considerations.
I deal with both, so it's important to know how the two are licensed. Didn't really consider the differences until I read about HDL (Hardware Description Language) licensing. Here's a good report/letter describing GPL pitfalls when it comes to hardware description (neither software or a physical hardware): https://ohwr.org/project/ohr-meta/wikis/Documents/GPL/LGPL-for-HDL:-open-questions

>I also realize that -- particularly in a hard-realtime embedded environment of a robowaifu, that such modular and clearly-demarcated software systems is neither efficient, nor economical, nor even practical, by-and-large.
Thanks for pointing that out. Even though I already knew about these limitations, hearing it now clicked in my head. For many reasons it is a better idea to use permissive licenses.

>I think licenses that are explicitly intended to free the IP to the extent humanly possible are by far our safest route here.

Indeed, that you are right. I have been weary of GNU's leftism, but I agree with the concept for non-real-time software applications. Perhaps that's the last remnants of my idealistic youth influencing my thoughts. Studying OpenBSD/FreeBSD has actually got me pondering on what sort of licensing I should really use.

>I realize I'm quite biased here. I can assure you that it's not a casual choice either, for whatever that's worth.

Hard to argue against this. Past experience has shown men that this is indeed what happens. Must be prepared for it.

>Also, would you care to spell out in further detail the terms 'strong license' and 'weaker license' if you would please?
Of course. I think I started using "weak" after seeing in the CERN Open Hardware License (OHL) page. Apologies for the confusion XD

Specifically CERN-OHL version 2 has three versions:
-Permissive (CERN-OHL-P)
-Weakly reciprocal (CERN-OHL-W)
-Strongly reciprocal (CERN-OHL-S)

CERN has a nice FAQ section on this:
https://ohwr.org/project/cernohl/wikis/FAQ#q-what-are-all-these-suffixes

Permissive is equivalent to BSD 3-Clause or Expat(MIT) where no changes need to be shared, only notices have to be retained. Relicensing is acceptable. This is likely the default license we should look into for any hardware (unless you know of equivalent licenses), as it explicitly covers production of products, not just distribution of the design files.

Weakly reciprocal kinda feels like LGPL. Source licensed under CERN-OHL-W cannot be relicensed (similar to Apache 2.0), however if this source is used in a bigger design, the rest of the design can be licensed differently. Apache 2.0 actually has a clause on contribution (section 5), which by default retains Apache 2.0 (but could be explicitly adjusted by the contributor). If you want your hardware design to keep the same license, but still be used in any project, this is not a bad choice.

Strongly reciprocal is equivalent to GPL (all changes to be published under same license). This license is similar to TAPR OHL v1.0 and GPLv3. In the context of licenses, I say "strong" when the license is "Copyleft" or similar to GPLv3. Only for projects that are fully open.

So for us, either permissive or weakly reciprocal are viable options as they could be used in higher performance (however specifically permissive when code has to be combined together in a single binary).
In further correspondence I'll try to use the terms "copyleft", "permissive", and "weakly reciprocal" to refer to the three categories set out by CERN-OHL.

Oh, and for convenience, here are the links to the licenses I discussed so far (Chobitsu feel free to adjust as needed):

Excellent response Anon, many thanks.

# 32
>>10927 >>10935
Thanks for all your input. I have to look deeper into this. Your link is again very fast about either the question if the wrapper is GPL, which isn't the issue. Or it's about linking within a binary, but not e.g. about importing some library in Python which interacts with some program written in C++.
I will most likely use GPL licenced programs by others in my AI, so if this taints it, then it can't be avoided anyways.

>>10931
>I also realize that -- particularly in a hard-realtime embedded environment of a robowaifu, that such modular and clearly-demarcated software systems is neither efficient, nor economical, nor even practical, by-and-large.
I don't see myself ever working on anything that lives up to your standards, so you don't need to worry about it :^)

# 33
An anon has begun a valuable documentation project regarding a power & control network (>>11018). He would like to use an alternative license for it.
>''"From a legal stand point, this is under CC0 or public domain..."''

Can we please have a discussion on it's compatibility with our main BSD-3/Expat(MIT) licensing suggested for all our works here (on-board or off) anons? I'm unsure what '''''CC0''''' means, but here's a listing from ''opensource.org''. Maybe it goes by an alternative name also?
https://opensource.org/licenses/alphabetical

# 34
>>11040
>CC0
As I suspected, it appears to be a ''Creative Commons'' license, the “No Rights Reserved” version. 
https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/public-domain/cc0/

I wonder why opensource.org doesn't list it?

# 35
>>11040
I think I'll use the MIT (Expat) license actually.
Although I probably will have some work in the public domain as well (it's more suited for small pieces of code or self-contained written pieces etc.)

I've considered using the GPL to ensure robowaifu progress remains open-source but the reality is people and companies use and modify GPL code without releasing their source code anyway. If your code is online it's up for grabs by anyone. Even if some company was clearly ripping someone's code, what could they even do about it? Who has the money to start an international lawsuit against a company, let alone win it?

And imagine how corrupt business would become if there was a government regulatory body that audited code for license violations. Large companies could easily bribe analysts to get the secrets of smaller competitors and whatever fines they incurred would just be a cost of doing business. This is how Amazon became so big. They infiltrate smaller competitors by any means possible, legal and illegal, copy them, operate at a loss until the competition is dead, then reap all the profits of that market with only a couple slaps on the wrist.

I think a more important question is how to realistically prevent ourselves from being cornered by corporations. As soon as we do something that attracts a significant amount of attention they're going to smell blood in the water, copy us (not necessarily our code), and devour whatever new market we created. Another anon once said the best thing is to create something they don't wanna touch because it's too politically incorrect, lewd or borderline illegal. That way they can't sniff out if there is a viable market to tap, but none of my projects fit that description. And there probably isn't an ideal way. We might just have to rely on creating something so good and in tune with what people want that no one wants the knock off, like the western Gatebox knock off.

What you are looking for is patent protection. Its honestly the only way to keep larger companies and bad actors at bay. Now this is time consuming as you need paint a broad brush so to only allow companies to make lesser products than your creation. Now on the bright side, you are free to release the code on a process that you have patented. You can even pull an industry standard tactic and give it away for free when used privately and charge when used commercially. 

To the topic on hand; 1) Would anyone be willing to write their own license that fits the needs of /robowaifu/? 2) Are the technicians ok with semi-open source? 

I'm gearing up to make a program akin to cortana that does housekeeping and looking into licenses on the FLOSS side, I recognized that an approach similar to dual-licensing would be ideal. Well more specifically: patenting the concept and application followed by source releasing the software side under a modified GPL v3. I only modify the clauses to restrict commercial/patent rights without my written permission and prevent combination to permissive licenses but only on the software that i release and license to the user. I know its not perfect, but a barrier to direct theft and maintains the potential for modification, while allowing the modifier to be compensated for their addition. 

My though process was: how is UE licensed? how do they allow add-ons? how do they allow commercialization of add-ons?
It was then I realized that open-source licensing is far too copyright focused and not enough thought placed on the patenting/process side of things. Copyright merely

I recently went through the patent process for a different product and it's not nearly as painful if you are friendly with a thesaurus. Now getting patent rights internationally is my next step.

What I always wondered about: Commercial can mean a lot of things. What's with someone making videos on YouTube with his robowaifu, which then are monetized? Or someone having a robowaifu singing songs in public and making money? This shouldn't require negotiations with every patent holder of some concept being used in some internal software. Though, then again, they might not go after it because it would be to expensive. But it could be a risk for robowaifu owners.

>>11817 can anyone claim that as theirs Later? sorry if this is rude question. also how do check if something has a license? in the office, one by one?

>can anyone claim that as theirs Later? 
Sorry, I'm not a lawyer Anon. Obviously, this student simply used a pre-prepared list, probably given him by his professor, who as I did copied it from elsewhere. Probably (for the most part) a compendium of old sayings gathered here & there (some undoubtedly centuries old) by some dedicated old soul in the past. That's the idea of ''archaic common-heritage''.

>also how do check if something has a license? 
Copyright and license aren't the same thing Anon, just so you're aware. For example you, yourself, are the copyright holder of the post you just made, ''not'' AlogSpace. Any author is immediately recognized legally as the sole copyright holder of his original work. 

Licensing, is another matter related to grants you make to others regarding that work. For example, by posting your original works here on this imageboard site, you are '''implicitly''' licensing ''AlogSpace'' (and anyone else for that matter such as me, your 'quoter'), to reproduce your copyrighted works here. This is the same condition we all experience here, and it's a commonly recognized form of agreement.

>in the office, one by one?
Lol no. Which 'office' would that be, by the way? The Internet is a big place.

# 44
>>11842
wait thats not copyright. thats ownership isnt it?
also since alog is anon then this is all public domain isnt it unless stated otherwise?

# 45
>>11842
the office would be like the one you can clickthru on youtube when it managed to identify the song? but it doesnt specify the list it just says copyright office.

# 46
>>11843
>wait thats not copyright. thats ownership isnt it?
It's both. You can transfer ownership and forgo copyright, but you can't legally invalidate your authorship, as long as it's authentically yours.

>>11844
That's getting into a level legal maneuvering I have no interest in understanding Anon. Again, I'm not a lawyer, and obviously Google doesn't own the works authors voluntarily post there. They are simply exploiters (a pretty typical approach for the globohomo, yes?)

# 47
>>11845
ok this is just confusing and somehow not clear enough despite its importance

# 48
>>11846
Heh, I'm sure lawyers would be quite pleased to hear you say that Anon. Good for their businesses, right?

So, I'm going to migrate this conversation over to the licensing thread, as we're well off-topic here -- even for a shitposting bread! :^)

Leaving this here as it has a clear, relatively easy-to-understand comparison of various licenses out there.

I use ISC.
It's almost a BSD-2-Clause equivalent. First, the text is more brief. Second, it doesn't specifically say that the license text has to be distributed with both the source and the binary forms of the program, it only says it has to be distributed with "copies". I use it for the brevity.

I've noticed some code that gets reimplemented over and over again, often poorly, so I started a project that tries to implement it properly with BSD-0-Clause which is derived from the ISC license but has its only 2 terms removed so it's public domain equivalent except it disclaims all warranties. I did it because I know even being told to copypaste the license text and to include it in releases is too much for some. The reason I use ISC over BSD-0-Clause in other projects is that there's some legal bullshit that says that if your warranty disclaimer isn't visible it doesn't count, and I assume nobody will go after my ass due to warranties, but that's no reason to stay vulnerable, so I use ISC unless I have a reason not to.

Ideally, copyright wouldn't exist, but the ISC license is written using language humans can read, and it essentially says "do whatever you want I don't care as long as you copy this license text" which is not perfect but good enough. I'm seeding terabytes of infringed copyright on my torrent client right now.

I wish there was a copyleft license that was compatible with 100% of free licenses. The idea behind copyleft is good, but the issue with copyleft licenses is that they end up cucking other FLOSS developers from using your software, and that's unacceptable. Working with every single FLOSS program like the permissive licenses do is a hard requirement for me.
But really, if someone copypasted my ISC software and didn't give me credit I wouldn't care, I would even be happy someone is using something I made, I really just want copyright and its supporters to die, to reiterate: singular reason that "copy the loicense pls" tidbit is in the license I use is to cover my ass, but ultimately, I want people to do whatever the heck they want with their copies.

BTW, OpenWRT violates the shit of all the licenses and gets into 0 trouble for it.
Go to the OpenWRT repositories right now and download any package, it's just a .tar.gz tarball with a different extesion. Look into the contents of the package: there is no license text anywhere.
A lot of FLOSS licenses require that the license text be distributed with binary, but OpenWRT simply doesn't do it. I approve.

OpenBSD does almost the same thing, they very rarely distribute the loicense, so they're violating the license of most of their packages with such a term.

This is in essence just what OpenBSD advocates today.
