Someone was planning to make an IRL drossel. It was cool, but the model he used was shit. I'm planning to have a project where one guy edits the model to accommodate servos and shit, one guy 3d prints/CNCs the parts (aluminum and silicone will be very important), one guy attaches the electronics, and one guy installs the AI.  
  
We will obviously need better models, and since the only models easily downloadable are Charming models (which while cute, will be fucking impossible because of her lack of feet). We may have to employ the unholy wizard known as ADR https://mobile.twitter.com/AdrianDustRed/status/1094362800573636608, because while he is a furfag dickgirl loving nigger, he has good models that can be edited to accommodate electronics.
