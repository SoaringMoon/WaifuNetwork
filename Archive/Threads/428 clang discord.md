I know this has probably been done a hundred times before. I don't care if you know who I am, as I already moderate the robosexual subreddit.

I have just made a discord server for people in the community who want to join, who don't care that much about anonymity related to this subject. Point is, I am an artificial intelligence safety researcher and want nothing more than to see a future with robowaifus.

It is much easier to coordinate in realtime

For the record this is not a NSFW server. I have no idea why it was tagged /clang/.

I don't mind you posting this in it's own thread (instead of /meta where it rightly belongs), but you should also introduce yourself in our Embassy Thread OP >>2823. Be aware that this is a SFW board.

==WARNING==
'''To any other anons considering this, but naive''' be aware that Discord is well-known for it's many privacy issues. If you care to know what I think of this opsec-related issue regarding your participation on /robowaifu/, you can read my post here >>5035

>>5053
Could be the prostitute image you chose for the OP pic, and the fact you felt compelled to point out that you moderate r/robosexual ? **Besides, it's only good manners to have a subject for your thread OP. :^) **

Forgive that I didn't lurk long enough before making a thread.

This discord will be primarily a center to organize like minded people to execute the scientific work required to make a attempt at designing a commercially viable recreational android.

>Discord, naivety, and operational security.
Because of my openness on other platforms, I am a very easy to dox individual. I am entirely aware of that, and know the risks involved. Others may not. Allow me to clarify and reiterate.

Fair enough, it's your life.
>Others may not.
Bet your ass they 'may not'. For something as potentially life-ruining as being publicly this topic is at this stage in history, you owe at least the basic courtesy of a ''Caveat emptor'' for the uninitiate, friend.

Discord is the exact '''opposite''' of good OPSEC.
