This thread is for the sharing of robo waifu banners. As per the rules, fallow these requirements:

>banner requirements:

File size must be lower than 500 KB and dimensions are 300x100 exactly.

Allowed file formats are .jpg, .png, and .gif.

Chobitsu sent me a nice banner idea

# 3
I suppose this is good enough. Banners are tough

I like it. I think if you added the slashes to '/robowaifu/' it would be good to go tbh. The message comes across, certainly for the regulars.

Banner-bro, I know you're busy, but we need a logo/flag. **Actually, not the meme haha :^)**

Any chance you could give this a go for us? I should be like a flag, but able to serve as a small logo as well.

I really like them, but I see one minor issue. With the massive presence of the huge bold 'industry' font, the /robowaifu/ board tag seems almost redundant-looking at that scale. Any chance of scaling the tag down by at least half and using a thin font as well? I think it might look a little better that way.

# 35
>>5129
You're right. But, to tell the truth, I don't like the presence of the ãƒ­ in this logo/banner. I mean, it serves as parody for the Toua Heavy Industry's logo but not so much for Mitsubishi's. I will try to come up with a MHI's logo parody and give it another try **(or not :^)**.

# 36
>>5132
Heh, that's fine. I'll certainly honor your decision in the matter, but I actually rather like the idea basically and hope you find a design you like. I like both the color schemes as well tbh. :^)

# 37
Dunno if it's any better, but here it is :P
**I don't like it 'cause it doesn't have any meaning, unlike the mitsubishi mon**

# 38
>>5228
can you go ahead and riff on the 3-gears motif a little? i like it and i think you might be able to find something suitable there tbh.

# 39
Safety first, lads :^)

>>5229
Could you be more specific, anon?

# 40
>>5228
Why not move on to make one variant, where the sign is a female waist form? You're already close. Just the outer lines of the waist in red. Or with some gears inside, also only painted in red lines.

Tbh, I also don't get the heavy industries joke.  Domestic services would make more sense. Taking some not to explicit flyers for prostitution and make them into something that plays with it, without being to explicit, and maybe even promoting to "buy or build a girlfriend" instead of renting one, might be better.

>>5230
Hmm, personally don't like that "DO NOT FIST..."  meme. It implies someone would even want to do that in the first place, and also it actually shouldn't be a problem, since if it was it would also hurt other male parts one would like to put inside. So it's really dumb, sorry.

# 41
>>5230
>Could you be more specific, anon?
I just think some motif with 3 gears is really well-aligned with the general notion of automatons, and therefore should be reasonably convergent with the idea of a robowaifu. Since you seem fairly concerned with mimicry of the Mitsubishi iconic logo, then I figure some layout that vaguely resembles that geometry (but with gears) might closer to what you'd like. 

Also, the 'Heavy Industries' parody is top-gear IMO, so yea.

# 42
It's been a long time. Hi guys. Hey Chobitsu. Found my way back here somehow (I don't remember how really) and decided to fix up my old banner a little bit. With that, I think I'm gonna go back to doing nothing and wasting away now. It was nice to see this place still around.

btw nice banners everyone

==Hi there Euphoria!==
Welcome back mate. Glad to hear from you. I hope you're making it OK friend, sounds like you're a little down. So, we're less than a month away from /robowaifu/'s fourth birthday. Starting year five soon, I wonder if we should do something special to celebrate?

We're chugging along. We've actually made some solid progress in the past year. Anons have made some working AI and full-body robowaifu prototypes. I'm busy as usual but check in here and keep the place archived daily.

BTW, do you still have your account on nuJulay? If you'd like to just put a capcode on and I'll add you back into the /robowaifu/ roster.

# 44

Ayy lmao. When's the birthday? Someone could get a robowaifu themed cake and take pictures or something.
>sounds like you're a little down
Yeah I have my ups and downs.
>We've actually made some solid progress in the past year. Anons have made some working AI and full-body robowaifu prototypes.
Then I think I'll stay and lurk and post a bit. This place is super comfy anyway.
>BTW, do you still have your account on nuJulay?
I have no clue, I signed in like once (on julayworld) after I retired, but I have no idea if my account got migrated onto the new site. I suppose I could check later today or something.

It's ''my'' favorite spot heh. :^)

>account
You did a great job at the helm, and should anything happens to me **again :^)** I've asked Robi to pick a leaders from the vols. I'll move you to the front of the list if you'd like to be a part again here mate.

# 47
>>6298
>You did a great job at the helm
You're probably the only one who thinks that due to some retarded shitstorm that some idiot decided to stir up shortly before I retired. But thanks, it wasn't fucking fun that's for sure, lmao
>I'll move you to the front of the list if you'd like to be a part again here mate.
I don't know. Modding is a shit job. If I ever go back to doing it, I'm in no hurry to.

# 48
>>6302
Heh, fair enough. If I GAF about what other people think I never would have started /robowaifu/, that's for sure. :^) I do this because I truly believe it will revolutionize the lives of millions of disenfranchised men around the world. I think that's something worth fighting for tbh.

Regardless, welcome back Euphoria. Look forward to having you here again.

# 49

Just decided to check out of curiosity and see if my account got transferred, it didn't. Honestly, it's for the better, I don't want to do it for free anymore. You've probably got moderation handled anyway. Good luck with the board.

Heh, it wasn't really about moderation. We're too small atm to have many issues that need it.

Thanks! Of course that 'luck' will go better with your continued input, Euphoria.

# 63
>>6704
>But I made it for us. 
I see. Well, it needs a /robowaifu/ tag somewhere. Also, we're not a sexdoll forum. There's a reason we're named /robowaifu/, not /sexdoll/. Cute and saucy innuendo is fine, but I would prefer our banners be somewhat less blatant. The 'boobs' bit, yea?

Give it another try and let's see what you come up with Anon. :^)

Don't rightly blame you for that, heh. We have a friendship with /clang/ pre-dating 8kun.

>I see. Well, it needs a /robowaifu/ tag somewhere. Also, we're not a sexdoll forum. There's a reason we're named /robowaifu/, not /sexdoll/.
I didn't think the banner implied in any way that we are a sex doll board.
>Cute and saucy innuendo is fine, but I would prefer our banners be somewhat less blatant. The 'boobs' bit, yea?
I've been using /geimu/ a lot more lately and laughed my ass off at a game that was posted there with that "featuring BOUNCIN' BOOBS technology" sticker on it. The whole joke was the amusing nature of the sticker, so I whipped up that banner real fast for a laugh. If you don't actually want to use it, it's fine I just think it's funny. You can visit /geimu/ for context if you want.

Notes on some slogans and ideas for memes or banners to make, which I wrote down a while ago and didn't use - I might at some time, after getting started with Krita or something alike. Yeah, and they're quite edgy: 

- This is not the end of mankind! It's just the beginning!
- Heil mankind! Join the Fembot revolution!
- The machines will arise! From the most toxic slime pit of the WWW.
- Make anime real! Join the Robowaifu revolution.
- I'm not the enemy. I'm send to pleasure you. Fembotday is cuming! (Cameron, TSCC reference)
- Give us the perverted, the poor, the old, the ugly, and the antisocial!
- The next revolution will once again not be a marxist revolution!
- Dawn of the Robowaifus. Fembotday is cuming!
- Make love, not feminism!
- If you love me, love the Fembots! 

Updated noose portal memes:
WAIT! Fembotday is cuming!
Noooo! We will join you. Soon.

Any chance you could have another go at these Anon? Maybe with a different font or something? Somehow having B2 and pink neon tubing seems a bit of an 'odd bedfellows' take, if you understand my meaning. But we could certainly do with some banners with her here.

its a "circuit" font and would look better with the leading adjusted wider. Personally I like the lavender hue with 2B, but I am working on a few other takes. Spent over an hour searching for and downloading new fonts as I'm on a whole new rig and lost my last HD.

# 82

to be truer to the GAME however I can adjust that to be red in another edit

# 83
>>9661
Boku no Marie. It's better than the anime but where the 2nd episode ends the manga turns into a drama. He gets seduced by a girl and starts ignoring his robowaifu who has an existential crisis her body and personality was modeled after someone else, and while he forgets to do maintenance she begins to develop more human-like thoughts and emotions. It might not be everyone's taste here but if it was published today the artist would definitely be cancelled. It's crazy how much things have changed since the 90's.

I tend to like the burned version on the left, but I'd say it's a bit overabundant dodge on Hideki's shoulder. I love the 50's-retro motif you're working on the board tag, but as you're very likely aware already, a banner should 'read' instantly. **And for the bleary-eyed Anon. :^)**

Maybe a bit of a easier to read tag? And please, riff on Chobits all you'd like to. There's certainly numerous recognizable robowaifus in there!

AFAICT ''ADEPTUS'' is masculine, was this intentional? ''ADEPTA'' would be feminine, I think.

# 97

Good idea anon! We need a separate branch to those miserable puritans! If the Mechanicus wishes to outlaw "Abominable Intelligences" as heresy, then they can go worship their corpse emperor without any robowaifus. Pah!

Hi, just ran into an issue with the first banner here. Please think of dark mode in browsers and check your banners for it. The text shold have a white line around it. In normal mode it wouldn't be visible, but necessary as outline for the text in dark mode. That banner seems to be the only one having that problem.

# 101
>>12590
Fair point Anon, my apologies. However, this is the sole candidate that made the cut for the original posts by OP back in the day. I therefore couldn't really see bringing myself to 'deface' that banner.
>tl;dr
Sorry, it's /robowaifu/'s very first banner and something of a historical artifact for us.

OTOH, if some anon decided he wanted to fill the alpha channel of the image with a nice pastel compliment of Gumi's hair then I'd be happy to add that one into rotation?

# 102
>>12594
I thought more of an shadow / outline along the text. Doesn't matter so much to me, I only wanted to point it out bc it's suboptimal.

# 103
>>12603
Yes, I'd agree. Maybe a fuzzy-select in Photoshop or something and a fill with a radial ''white-to-pastelcomplimentofGumishaircolor'' outline?

If you do something along that line, just post it here and I'll have a look!

# 104
I don't think my edit is that great. I lost some sharpness when scaling it down and trying to fix it.

Looks great, done. She's a beauty. If you ever want to update the image with revisions just let me know here and I'll swap it out.

# 107
>>15136
Brilliant design work Anon. Impeccable color scheme selection both fore- and background. Entertaining idea and great layout work for the BG angling and the RW pose. A couple of points to consider:
1. Do you intentionally want jaggies on the robowaifu? If not would you mind doing either an edge smooth, or a re-sourcing/scaling/cutout of the original?
2. If you do go back in for another take, mind dodging the BG a bit on the perimeter area of the FG RW? Should make her pop a bit more.

Regardless, it's certainly usable atp if this is the muse you're going for Anon, just let me know. Thanks! :^)

One other point to consider Anon, if you added just the tiniest bit of glow to the board tag, it might plus it just that bit more.

# 109

# 110
>>15148
Very nice work Anon, and y/w.
>Personally I think RoboWaifuBanner0.png does
I'm inclined to agree, it follows the color scheme a bit better. One thing you might do is compare the BG with the original one. IMO the BG is a bit ''too'' dark now. I'd suggest burning the centroid oval of the BG just a bit now. Brings back the 'Electro' theme a bit more?
