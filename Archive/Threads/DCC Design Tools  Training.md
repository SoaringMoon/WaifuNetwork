Creating robowaifus requires lots and lots of design and artistry. It's not all just nerd stuff you know Anon! :^)

'''ITT:''' Add any techniques, tips, tricks, or content links for any ''Digital Content Creation'' ('''DCC''') tools and training to use when making robowaifus.

I spent some time playing with the program Makehuman and I'll say I wasn't impressed. It's not possible to make anime real using Makehuman, in fact the options (for example eye size) are somewhat limited. But there's good news, don't worry!

The creator of Makehuman went on to create a blender plugin called ManuelBastioniLAB which is much better (and has a much more humorous name). The plugin is easy to install and use (especially if you have a little blender experience). There are three different anime female defaults that are all pretty cute. (Pictured is a slightly modified Anime Female 2.) There are sliders to modify everything from finger length to eye position to boob size. It even has a posable skeleton. Unfortunately the anime models don't have inverse kinematic skeletons which are much easier to pose. Going forward I'm probably going to use ~~MasturBationLAB~~ManuelBastioniLAB as the starting point for my designs.

In this thread we discuss various CAD software for the purpose of making access easier for others to get started. I'm using Fusion360. Other good options are Blender and FreeCAD. Fusion360 is the easiest to use imho and is free unless your business makes over 100,000 dollars. 

Post software, tutorials, tips and tricks you've learned, etc. Let's make designing waifus easier for each other!

I've tried out ManuelBastioniLAB and it's very comprehensive while easy to use. It's been discontinued and forked into the MB-Lab project now.

There's a way to add in genitals or remove the modesty coverings but the default program doesn't include them in order to get around strict pornography laws in European jurisdictions.

Ah, thanks for the update anon. Dollfan would be glad to know I imagine. Any way of ''adding'' the genitalia feature back into the program you know of? Asking for a friend.

# 5
It's been awhile since I've used it and I can't find any information on how to do so as manuelbastioni.com/guide_tips.php is down.

Trying it out in Blender 2.8 I have no idea what's going on with this new UI. Ah got it, go into edit mode and select the MBlab_generic material. Assign the MBlab_human_skin to it and it's replaced. Hopefully this webm helps, don't know why the mouse pointer isn't showing up.

A lot of SFM model creators use modding tools in Skyrim to make a base for their models. It does a decent rigged body that's very customizable with a simple UI but getting Skyrim with porn mods setup properly is a pain in the ass. Loverslab is where that community hangs out for adult mods and allthefallen.ninja is for loli mods.

Two sites that have a good collection of 3d models are sfmlab.com(requires an account to see nude models but all it takes is a disposable email) and smutba.se , you might get lucky on DeviantArt and tumblr too.

And on this site we've got someone creating his waifu in VR over in /agdg/30078 with constant updates on his progress. There's also /3d/ that's somewhat active and has tons of good resources for Blender.

I'm not very knowledgeable about the MMD or VRchat community but here's a booru for the first one, sometime links to the models are posted

# 10
Any professional-tier 3D modeling/animation suite like Maya, 3DStudio Max, Motion Builder, SoftImage, and even Blender more and more, will have some type 'human-builder' plugin available either in-product or as a third-party plugin.

I think MoBu has the simplest and most intuitive IK/FK humanoid shell-rigging system I've ever worked with tbh.

# 18

Yes Anon, and you can use it for free. One of the more interesting features is the ability to collaborate. We could set it up so that multiple Anons can work on the same project together. 
www.autodesk.com/products/fusion-360/compare
Let's all learn together.

# 19
I'm going to check this software out OP.

# 20
This software is amazing OP I thank you immensely for bringing this to my attention. I've used other CAD software like Rhino and FreeCAD, and I could never get into them for one reason or another. Fusion360 is great in my first 30 minutes with it I designed a basic mock-up of a forearm. It's really intuitive and I recommend it to anyone struggling to find something they like.

# 21

It's fantastic to hear an Anon benefited from this thread. I'd really appreciate if you posted pictures of your progress, either here or potentially your own that if you're planning a project you'd like to share.

Personally I'd recommend using onshape for anyone who doesn't already have cad.
www.onshape.com/

It's fairly similar to solidworks so it's very easy to pick up and can be accessed from anywhere with a web  browser. The models can be shared and edited publicly so it makes it easy to collaborate. It was sort of made for open source projects like this. Entirely free to use as well.

# 24
>>1167
>It was sort of made for open source projects like this. Entirely free to use as well.
This looks really interesting. As great as Fusion360 is there are two issue holding me back on it. A) It's owned by Autodesk, and having experience with them in other industries I'm hesitant to go there again. B) It doesn't run natively on Linux. I have come to literally hate both Microsoft and Apple over the last few years. They have become enemies of their own users. Otherwise it's amazing.

While I haven't looked too closely at onshape yet (I will now after you're post) there's one thing I really like about it: it runs on Linux with no complications. However, I'd like to ask you first: We need to ensure that we can both download and work locally on models offline. If (((they))) pull the plug on us, we'd be '''fucked''' if we had to reach the cloud to work on our designs thereafter. Very risky weakness if we have to imo.

Ideas?

# 25
>>1167
Good find Anon, it works on pretty much anything with an internet connection and send to show for easy collaboration. Overall great software for learning. Though if using for professional development for production, Fusion360 is cheaper 125 a month. If you're interested in learning CAD or only want to make open source designs and have a solid internet connection, this is a great choice.

>>1168
You are free to download your designs and work on them offline through other CAD programs. You're right in that if they pull the plug, you're fugged. It's a program that requires there servers to function.

I'm surprised nobody mentioned the newer Illusion games, they allow for quite a bit of customization of 3d models and since it uses the Unity engine it can be easily exported for use in other 3d editors. As games or VR sex simulators they're not very good, better to use them as an animation studio or model builder.

There's also a huge community making their own characters and sharing them online on imageboards or on boorus thanks to the 'card' save feature. Just find a character you like, save the .png card into your UserData/chara/female/ folder and it's ready to use.

I'd recommend trying out Koikatsu as it's the most popular one at the moment and there's a newer torrent out that includes all the most important mods preinstalled.
https://sukebei.nyaa.si/view/2849724

I spent a dozen hours in it and the UI is still feels odd but very simple compared to dedicated 3d programs. I mostly screw around in the Chara Studio program rather than the main game. Unfortunately most of the community for it hangs out on Discord but you find guides for it and tips on installing it with Wine on the HGames Wiki.

# 44
>>1505
I don't vidya much these days anon **never did really tbh** too tied up with school and coding. That sounds interesting though. You mentioned you've spent some time in it. Any chance you show us some of your results? Not prying just curious what's being done by anons here.

# 45
>>1506
I'm just screwing around in it so I don't have anything to show off, I thought about giving an example with that post but just clicking on any of the links will provide some. At first I tried it out for the character modeling but the animation studio is what I find the most useful. This video gives an idea of how it works.

It's more of a simulator with 3d models than a game, the reason why I think it's pertinent to this board is you can pipe the chroma keyed video output of animated characters for several purposes. I remember one guy on here wanted to make a virtual desktop assistant program and this would be perfect for that.

The aspect I'm most interested in is using it with AR/VR which I'm having trouble to get working as the VR version is designed for the main game to work with the Vive headset and that whole ecosystem isn't something I'm interested in. I'm currently doing tests having two programs running and slightly changing the camera angle. By binding headset tracking to the camera on both instances it should work.

# 46
>>1507
Thanks anon. That does look pretty easy to use and the waifu is cute. I'm assuming it's also pretty easy to animate since you mentioned that specifically? 

I'm not exactly sure I understand how the details of the chroma key function will support the anon**s** who want to make a virtual/visual waifu? Though it seems like it would be good for it from your statement.

I hope you can figure out how to do VR w/o relying on the commercial Vive, etc. platforms. Open-source VR gear when?

# 47
>>1508
The chroma keying works by selecting a solid color background like in this video. Then sending the output of the window into ffmpeg using gdigrab you use -filter_complex 'colorkey=0x<color>' to remove the color. Then there are many ways to display a transparent video output with characters on your desktop depending on the DE/WM you use.

The animation is what really surprised me with Chara Studio, I'm used to standard 3d software where you have to waste time rendering to see if it's any good and it takes forever to learn all the intricacies. With this software it's all live and through easy to select FK/IK options you can modify the basic animations. Of which there are a lot of.

And by this time next year I expect OpenXR to be usable with a third party tracking solution that's supported, it should already work right now. They can output video to almost all the headsets out right now but the issue is position data.

# 48
>>1509
Aha. I think I understand that a little better now thanks anon. That sounds like pretty compelling experience with the animation, I think ''simple to use'' is a better choice than ''extravagant array of features'' for the majority of us anons heh.

Do you think OpenXR to become popularly supported similar to say, OpenGL? 
>position data
Are there any good open source Kinect-like alternatives or something functionally similar? Has a new market formed to fill the Kinect void?

# 49
>>1509
PS. Moar Chii tbh! :^)

# 50
>>1505
I'll give it a look anon, thanks for bringing it up.

# 51
To keep this on topic there's also the Custom Maid 3D series that's similar to Koikatsu. You can find a 122gb torrent for it on nyaa.si

>>1510
OpenXR is made by the Khronos group and they're the people who are behind the OpenGL replacement Vulkan so industry support is guaranteed.

As for tracking that's a whole different can of worms, there's NOLO VR that's not very well supported but works at the moment and Valve's lighthouse system that's currently being reverse engineered through libsurvive. I'd give VR another year or two to mature before buying into it as it's still a mess. And even then buy something cheap and used.

# 58
Other than the following links, anyone aware of any good human anatomy models to use as a basis for the internal mechanisms? Having an external form will be useful as a basis, but for CAD work of mapping out the actual mechanisms it seems like having more than just a shell to work with could be good.
I have a few links to some very nice resources for human anatomical models, but the download speeds are terrible and it isn't customization in their proportions.

https://grabcad.com/library/human-anatomy-v4-male-life-sciences-japan-bodyparts3d-source-1/details?folder_id=4247170

There seem to be a few different currents here, which is good, but for those who want a more biomimetic waifu, organs and bone structure should maybe be considered at least for design. Are there any easier ways to go about this that I am unaware of?

# 59
>>4450
Looking at the anatomy is certainly very useful, it would be even better if we had a 3d model of a young woman which we could adapt to our needs.
In the ideal case, the most human-like waifus will feel similar to humans from the outside. We could find the bones we need to keep and the ones which could be bigger or differently shaped in the waifu.

# 60
>>4450
There are actually anatomy programs that actually used in pre-med/med schools as reference and teaching aids. They are entirely commercial products and they don't give their models away for free. But if you're so inclined to obtain a copy and use is simply as interactive reference, you probably couldn't find a better type of resource along these lines Anon.

>it would be even better if we had a 3d model of a young woman which we could adapt to our needs
I agree. I was hoping that there would be other sources with different human models that could be exported to a CAD program but it seems like there may not be. There are tons of resources on human body proportions and the difference between male and female proportions, but I have no idea how to translate that into a things like bone structure and musculature on the design level. The resources I linked were created with scans of at least one human, I'm not sure if more were used, and finding human models already in existence has proved fruitless.

https://www.intechopen.com/books/machine-learning-and-biometrics/a-human-body-mathematical-model-biometric-using-golden-ratio-a-new-algorithm
This is a decent paper on human body proportions, but it is also male. There are other proportional charts and papers that go over females but this one seemed the most comprehensive generally which is why I saved it. Referencing the differences between the sexes and applying it to the more detailed male model seems a decent temporary solution.

>>4465
Fantastic resource anon!
This will definitely be useful for reference in understanding anatomy and biomechanics.

I feel obligated to speak up and let you know I will oppose any male-oriented project work attempted here on /robowaifu/. Other groups are free to take our work and do with it as they will, but /robowaifu/ is strictly, well, ''waifu''-oriented.

# 64
>>4481
I think it's about finding ways to use the male bone model and then changing it based on other infos.

# 65
>>4481
Waifus are my goal as well, but without a decent internal model to work with I feel that altering a male form to be better proportional to a female form may be the best course of action for the development of a biomimetic android. If someone could find a female base to work with I'd be more than happy to use it, but until then altering a male model to be female is much more straightforward than translating MRI data into something more workable.

That said, the proportionality of the human body has been a pain to try and sift through. If there are any better proportionality charts and algorithms than the one I posted here >>4480 please let me know.

# 66

There are more and more specialized free programs where the results can be exported to other programs, like Blender.

Update on Solvespace: There's no way to import . STL files or any other files into it. It's easy to use for ones own design, but not to work with other files, except the creator shared the Solvespace files.
However, I also found Wings3d and Makehuman are installable on my Raspi3. I'll try Wings3d first, since I cant imagine Makehuman would be working fine, and also because I only want to change same smaller parts from Thingyverse and such.

# 72

>do these work OK on a SBC like that?

# 73
>>4802
I'm using Meshlab for repairs and filters, Wings3D for some extrusions and creating new simple meshmodels, though in the future I might use Solvespace for that, Prusa Slicer for cutting mesh models and adding parts for support (I don't mean the regular auto- generated supports, but manually added ones). I tried Blender briefly, though it's really slow with a complex mesh model on a Raspi3. I didn't even try to use Make Humans yet. Misfit Models 3d works well for some things, it can open dxf files but not stl, while Wings3D doesn't accept dxf but stl, and Solvespace takes only dxf or its own file format.

Meshlab is very responsive and has a lot of filters, but the file I repaired with it still had errors in Prusa Slicer and caused a faulty print, while it didn't make it easier to cut it. Cutting whole models into parts  in Prusa Slicer causes severe errors (deformations) in that model most of times, which then need to be repaired manually, taking hours (for a beginner)...

By now I'm completely opposed to the workflow of mixing CAD designed exact parts with mesh models, like the developer of Sophie does, but also the developer of InMoov seems to have done. This kind of mixing needs to be kept to a minimum for good design.

# 74
Before I forget it again: Congratulations to your progress in learning Fusion360, especially the more advanced options. Autodesk thanks you a lot for enjoying their product. Autodesk is so happy for everyone, they just announced that Fusion360 won't have so many options in the free version anymore. Now you can support them with a regular monthly payment or once a year, and therefore contribute to the further development of their product, and so help them to create even better and more expensive options. You can even get some bonuses here and there, maybe. So you won't need to spend to much. Hmmm.. Okay?

# 75

Don't forget to export your files in every format they allow right now, you might need these files  later. Not sure if dxf works everywhere, and how well. Every progamm has its own format, and it seems to be difficult to write code for import.

# 77
I found the option to make more complex round forms in Solvespace version 3, the one in some repositories is 2.3 (e.g. Raspian). Not sure if it's in these old versions. I'm using the version from Github now, which even builds on a Raspberry Pi 3 directly. It can create a helix or revolve around some point, but not completely. I want to use this to build many parts which will assemble to something bigger, for example a skull or a abdomen. Only if absolutely necessary their should be some small parts added which a sculpted. I want everything in CAD (parametric design), so I can add cavities and then holders or levels on the inside, or scale and slice the whole thing however I want to. 
The example pic with the abdomen is from Sophie (stl-file in the Mega cloud of the developer). The green part is a example in CAD, which isn't perfect, but it shows that I might be able to build something alike step by step. This might also be more useful if something is supposed to be a mold for silicone rubber, bc I can work on the inside of such a model by making a cavity with the same shape but maybe some extras like the negative of the belly button.
I'm still playing around and learning, so don't hold your breath for something complete coming very soon. I'm working parallel on may different parts, however I feel like. I found that in some cases it's good approach to use the 2D preview of a stl-file in a slicer to get some picture with a pattern as orientation. Also using 3D sculpted models for comparison.

Thanks for the progress reports Anon. I really wish you good success in devising a robowaifu design system based on a SBC system like the RPi. If we can bring the costs down of everything -- including the design process -- then we can see many more anons getting their own robowaifus. I like the thinking about parametric design work. BTW, this kind of facility is also included in packages like Blender and Maya. It's called NURBS there, and as you suggest is a fast, powerful way to make all kinds of geometric edits. But personally, I'd feel a lot better knowing that at least '''one''' of us was taking the time to master SolveSpace too.

Godspeed in your research and studies Anon!

>>8076
Glad to see at least some of Sophie's early parts are coming in handy for learning/conceptualisation of your robowaifu!

Managed to 3D-print her entire right hand and half her forearm in the space of 24 hours today using a single 3D printer. I want her to be low cost, easy to fix and mass-manufacture! Not just so that any damage is easily repaired, but so that other people can easily build upon and make use of her parts.

I wonder how good Blender is at parametric design. I while ago the message was that it isn't  really good at it, but it might progress fast. I think the fundamentals can be learned with many programs, then transferred to many of them.

# 82
>>8102
I'm not too sure how well NURBS+Subdiv works on Blender yet, but with Maya it's definitely pro-tier. My guess is the Ton & crew are very quickly catching up in basically every area that they may lag behind the big boys. After all, the Blender Foundation is now literally raking in millions a year as many major studios have begun coming on board with the tool since the very innovative v2.8 dropped. In fact, a number of them are literally sending engineers to work right alongside the Blender devs to help them integrate features they deem essential. True 'skin in the game' move.

It's been a long **25+ years lol** haul for Ton, but he's finally become an 'overnight' success at last. Blender is amazing now, and I definitely mean to dig deeply into it this year and start creating a virtual waifu for our MRS simulator so we can finally use it with at the least a virtual waifu's face in it.

Yep, I think you're right.

# 83
Still trying out different stuff (pics related). Often not with some specific goal in mind, just for testing. However, combining different 3D parts in one assembly turned out to be more difficult than anticipated. I might have to learn a bit more, to get better at it. For now I focus on playing and low hanging fruits (crude prototypes).

>>8079
> devising a robowaifu design system based on a SBC system like the RPi
This works to some extend, but it' wont' work for 3D sculpting. Also, I'm only doing this because I can't get myself to install and configure a new Linux on my laptop. Sooner or later I'm going to do that, though. I also intend to buy a PC for machine learning and some other things like 3D modelling, after I moved to another place. If I tried this now, I couldn't be sure when the parts arrive, and I'm busy anyways.

# 84
>>8110
I like the details of these cutaways Anon. Nice work. Seems to me you're really starting to get the hang of designing useful parts. Keep it up!

# 85
Has anyone here tried OpenSCAD yet? An anon mentioned it once here >>4554 but afaict there weren't any responses about it yet. It seems promising on the surface of it. It seems like is supports programmability for creating models, which as a programmer I find quite interesting. There is some kind of library available for it (Presumably it's a library of modeled parts, etc. pic #2 related ). The source code is available for building it directly for your machine.
https://github.com/openscad/openscad
https://www.openscad.org/cheatsheet/index.html

# 86
>>8469
I have the tab open for quite a while, but didn't try it out. Seems to be interesting, I might look into it this year at some time. It's probably going to be about finding out what workflow works better, programming or working with the mouse. The problem is that these programs have no good exchangeable file formats. 
What might be interesting about OpenSCAD is that it might be possible to train programs to create object, while comparing it to a real object with image recognition, or to use it in a physics simulation. Maybe we can use this at some point  to have our waifus imagine objects and run simulations to figure out how to handle them, a bit like dreaming or like planning and understanding how things work through imagination.

The designer of Alitas bodies in the live action movie :
> https://vitalybulgarov.com/alita
>Software-wise I used: ZBrush for initial sculpting(shape exploration), then Softimage XSI(for SUBD parts) and Moi3D(for CAD parts) for final surfaces/detailed work. Bodies rendered in Keyshot and the heart was rendered in Octane (I transitioned to Octane Render at the end of the project). 
Doesn't help me much, tbh. 

Except the term SUBD helped me to find this:
https://solidedge.siemens.com/en/solutions/products/3d-design/subdivision-modeling/
Subdivision Surface Modifier — Blender Manual: https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/modeling/modifiers/generate/subdivision_surface.html
This might be the knowledge I lacked to get ahead. It's for the creation of more complex organic forms, but not (horrendous) 3D sculpting.

# 88
>>9355
I might be able to help you sort through some of that Anon. But honestly, you are already on the proper course by focusing on Blender instead **unless you are independently wealthy**. Today, Blender is not only still a ''free'' product (both as in beer and speech), but it also __kicks ass__ too. Several studios have begun migrating to it, and Ton is now raking in over a million a year to grow the Blender Foundation's efforts with the platform.

It shouldn't be the ''only'' tool in your pouch, but Blender should generally be the first thing you reach for Anon.

Blender Foundation has now released their next LTS version 2.93 . This version will be actively supported for two years.
https://www.blender.org/download/releases/2-93/

It has a remarkable new array of features. The geometry nodes and line art tools could be quite helpful to some of the kinds of work we might do here on /robowaifu/.

After dabbling in the 3D modelling community for a few months now I've realized a lot of people just use other models as bases for new ones and creating a good one from scratch can take a whole week.

DeviantArt seems to be the most popular source for models: https://www.deviantart.com/search/deviations?q=mmd&order=all-time
And SketchFab: https://sketchfab.com/search?q=anime&sort_by=-relevance&type=models (after filtering the results by clicking Downloadable)

The CATS plugin makes it easy to import and work with anime models that are usually in MMD format: https://github.com/GiveMeAllYourCats/cats-blender-plugin
And there's also the mmd_tools plugin: https://github.com/powroupi/blender_mmd_tools

Mixamo makes it stupidly easy to animate any humanoid model and get it moving in a game engine: https://www.mixamo.com/

I'm pretty hyped how close I'm to having a virtual waifu. Just a year ago I couldn't imagine myself ever doing any sort of 3D stuff.
And this shit is gonna be so easy for people once it's all together. Just adjust the blend shapes, pick a hair style, clothing, hair color, etc. Then pick a voice and personality for her and challenge your waifu to a game of strip checkers.

If I can wrap my head around 3D file formats I'd love to take a shot at generating character models with AI next year. It wouldn't have to generate the whole thing. It could work in pieces, making random adjustments for the user to select what they like and blend the samples they like together, sort of like how 2D waifus can be generated. The Blender API would make it possible to generate stuff directly in the editor too. What a time to be alive.

# 94
>>11556
Neat! Thanks for the information and links Anon. I think you're right about things like Blender's Python API making things possible to generate automatically. And there are other options available today, like things ITT.
>What a time to be alive.
Indeed. Let the virtual waifu armies arise!!

# 95
One of my favorite things about Blender is how it's entirely self-contained, cross-platform, no install needed. Drag-and-drop and it just werks. Honestly, I can't think of a single other large program that does this as well. **OTOH, building it all from ''source'' can be a bit rough! :^)**

# 96
This isn't so much a tool per se but I learned most of what I know about 3D modelling from watching Shonzo make anime models from scratch. Often he uses screencast keys during his streams so you can see the hotkeys he uses during his workflow. Posting this here since there isn't really a general 3D modelling thread or art thread.

Cheers anon! This thread is awesome! Bookmarked into my 3D modelling folder.

You can also download a bunch of reference books from Z-library and Library Genesis (you may need to register on their website and use Tor for certain titles). Just type in Blender and you'll find several 2020 titles on game and character design using both Blender and Unity Engine. (I can't post them here due that being piracy).

Shonzo is a narcissist troon and an idiot who couldnt teach if their life depended on it.

Literally all that literal faggot does is have its stream chat stroke its ego cock while answering zero questions nor explaining any of his processes.

Anyone who considers a timelapse a “tutorial” and labels it as such like Shonzo does is:
1. Wasting your time
2. Incredibly retarded and should be avoided.
3. They do VR chat models. Obviously pozzed.

There are literally dozens of better resources out there like Grant Abbot who actually teach you what the fuck they know and show you step by step without any of the 500x 30+ minute timelapse video titled “tutorials” that Shonzo and their ilk does.

The thread is gone, but 4chan and probably others have boards for drawing, sculpting, etc which could be useful for us. Here's also some archive: https://4chanarchives.com/board/3/ though I didn't find the thread from my posting above. I also didn't save it, since it was from befor we had Bump.

# 106
==Note:==
I'm going to go ahead and merge this with the 3D Models of Humans thread soon >>415 . There's some instructional information already there on these kinds of topics, and we have already similar information spread out too far. I'll probably change the subject of that thread to make it more general.

'''>---'''

'''Mostly playlists of Blender artists and other arts-related or technical training channels.'''

==SAVE.EVERYTHING.==

I know we have the ''Tools to Create 3D Models of Humans'' (>>415) and ''Robowaifu Design Software'' (>>414) threads. But this thread is actually closer in intent to the ''ROBOWAIFU U'' (>>235) & the ''Humanoid Robot Projects Videos'' (>>374) threads, in that it's more about ''training'' and ''videos'' but with a focus on ''learning'' the products like Blender, Krita, Solvespace, Kdenlive, Godot, etc., or the techniques themselves.

I even hope Bob Ross' shows and other kinds of similar video lists will be placed ITT since it's also arts, and __far too little attention is being given to arts on /robowaifu/ currently!__. 
>''"We are creating an active hobbyist scene of builders, programmers, '''artists''', designers, and writers using the technology of today, not tomorrow. Join us!"''

Thankfully, that seems to be changing a bit recently, and hopefully this information can help speed that up. Also, I figure it might be helpful if the whole group here had a kind index of arts-related & technical video content out there. Easier to find a few of the things that might be of interest to the robowaifuists here.

''Oh yea Anon, did I mention this...''
**==SAVE.EVERYTHING.==**
**:^)**

# 107
>>12245
==SAVE.EVERYTHING.==? Pfft, Wat?

I know you might be asking yourself this question, Anon:
>'''But why do I need to save ''anything'', much less __everything__?''' After all, it's current year and we have the Internet. Don't we live in a society? Can't I just watch every.thing.ever. 24/7 on Google YouTube with my handy Apple iPad? Obviously that's NEVER going to change, so why even worry about it?
If that's you asking yourself that right about now Anon, I have just two words for you:
**'''HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA'''**

OK, so maybe that's more than two, but I hope you get the point. Leftists and their cancel-culture frenzy won't be satisfied until their snowflake-safespace 'utopias' are literally free of any and every last little crumb of wrongthink. Perfect little infobubbles. Oh, and BTW Anon...''The Ministry of Truth'' and ''The Ministry of Love'' would both like to have a word with you about that 'robowaifu' thing of yours, "'''You got a loicense for that, Mate?''' It's on un-approved lists, it is."
>tl;dr
Your favorite channels may not be around forever Anon. Better get 'em now while you still can.

Alright, enough preaching to the choir here. Maybe **like me** you've already accumulated your own copies of literally thousands of videos such as these but ''just in case'', how do you go about this yourself if you haven't done? Well for starters if you don't already know about it then run, don't walk, and setup a copy of youtube-dl on your box right now.  ('''''1''''')

Then, create a directory to contain all the downloaded video, subtitles, descriptions, and other content for each playlist. A convenient way for a beginner would be to simply copy/paste the naming I use:  ('''*''')
> #1 #2

Create a new text file in that same directory, named the same ''as'' the directory, with the extension '''.m3u''' added.
> #3

Copy the list text from the codeblock itself and paste it into your new text file
> #4
This is the playlist, which you can run with '''mpv'''.  ('''''2''''')

Open that directory and run the youtube-dl command (posted here in the codeblock related to that playlist). So, for the above example, you'd run this from the terminal:
[code]youtube-dl -i --write-description --write-auto-sub --sub-lang="en" https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLn3ukorJv4vvJM7tvjet4PP-LVjJx13oB[/code]
It's probably easier on you if you first create a script with the youtube-dl command + the initial 4 (of the 5) params in a script file in your home directory, then just call that from your new playlist's download directory. That's how I do it:
> #5

Seems like a lot of work I imagine, but really stuff like this just becomes second nature before long. Do it regularly enough, and soon you too will have an entire library of training resources you can call up in a moment's notice -- and which can't be taken down on you.

Cheers, Anon.

This here >>13721 is related to Vroid Studio and why it isn't good for modelling body parts for 3D printing.
I wonder which other programs won't work for similar reasons. Also, I was impressed with the option of laying out the skin in Vroid Studio. This might be useful for creating some textile part and/or mold for a silicone skin and also adding sensors to it. I only saw this in a video and wonder if that works in other programs as well.

>>13741
The problem of skinning a complex 3D topological shell down into a flat 2D plane is both an interesting one, and one that's important to us here on /robowaifu/ (particularly to say, our papercraft waifu Anons). It's also fairly challenging to do well, as I'm sure our 3D modelling Anons who are doing meticulous UV layouts know right well.

However, please do try to avoid the grotesque while you're here Anon, it's not really our thing on /robowaifu/.
