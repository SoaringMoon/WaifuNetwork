I'd like to have a place to accumulate video links to various humanoid – particularly gynoid – robotics projects are out there. Whether they are commercial scale or small scale projects, if they involve humanoid robots post them here. Bonus points if it's the work of a lone genius.

I'll start, Ricky Ma of Hong Kong created a stir by creating a gynoid that resembled Scarlett Johansson. It's an ongoing project he calls an art project. I think it's pretty impressive even if it can't walk yet.

Very interesting development on joints, this wrist mechanism using a parallel or delta style approach is easy to manufacture for how complex it is and could work for the neck/ankle/hip too. There's a link to a github in the comments to 3d print your own.

https://hackaday.com/2019/10/20/humanoid-robot-has-joints-that-inspire/



That site also has another project for a humanoid robot project here, the GPLv3 software it uses is still being updated.

That joint is effin amazing tbh. At first I just assumed it was so flexible because the connecting elements were just squishy (and therefore not strong). Now that I realize the entire thing made of metal alone I have to say I'm pretty impressed with that clever design. Nice.

I just wanted to watch this video https://youtu.be/L6qI9wFjRTc for relaxation, and thought explicitly it won't be worth putting it in here. But there are several human-like robot projects I never heard of, or forgot about them. And they claim that they're 3d printable. Didn't look into the details yet, though.
- Plen2
- Jimmy project
- Rosa the Robot
- Igus humanoid
- Thormang 3
Of course, I already knew about Poppy and InMoov.

# 20
>>5452
Poppy is the most impressive of those to me with human-like movement and gait. I wonder how long it will take to prototype and build a full robowaifu when Poppy takes 7 hours to assemble with ready-made parts and instructions: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52Lqz3xDBvc

# 21
>>5454
I dont know, Poppy is based on very expensive servos. I'm impressed, but not that much. If I had the time and knowledge, and maybe soon this will be the case, then I would take the files and combine it with cheaper sensors in the joints and cheaper motors, also maybe some pneumatics.

# 22
>>5358

Had a good look at James Bruton's "Performance Robots". He uses fairly expensive ODrive brushless DC motor drivers ($119 dollars each and there's three per robot). The movement of the arms was very impressive. However, the main drawback I could see in his design was the stiffness of the torso. There was very little sideways motion and not much more front-back movement either. Basically what we need is a version of the Poppy torso but using much cheaper servo motors.

# 23
>>5563
Okay, very interesting. He said it was only a showcase, not something to copy anyways, so I don't mind that it has downsides. He showed that he can develop something that walks, and three hundred something for to main motors is quite a difference to 6-7k for the Poppy servos (maybe it's cheaper now).

Don't worry about it Anon, just dump anything you consider interesting for us ITT. Now that we have an indexing thread too, eventually we should all be able to sort where everything is for ourselves. Thanks for these videos.

# 26
A InMoov video from his creator himself, fom 2016: https://youtu.be/2sZOyCBbows - nice overview but it also shows the limits: Noise of the motors, difficulty to understand commands, limits of using only AIML, slow processing on a tablet from 2016 and maybe using the net for responses, cant move his legs, ... Though, this came later, here: https://youtu.be/nri0cCRRVH8 and  https://youtu.be/Bn39OzLrtyk

BTW, a Nanon on nano/g created a simple BASH script that retries youtube-dl downloads up to 10 times automatically if Y*utube rejects a torsocks-based connection with a 429 error. **You ARE using Tor to download anything from any G*ogle properties, aren't you, Anon? :^)**

Thanks, but I wrote a probably better script in a more readable language a while ago. It's on some SD card somewhere, I hope. Currently I don't need it.
>Tor
I'm using the official Youtube app on my Android tablet, where I'm logged into my Google account, where they have my debit card data. I'm not using Tor for archiving with Youtube-dl, because I'm assuming that these IPs wouldn't make it easier to download many files.

# 29

>I'm using the official Youtube app on my Android tablet, where I'm logged into my Google account, where they have my debit card data.
Haha, fair enough. What else can I say to that? :^)

>I'm not using Tor for archiving with Youtube-dl, because I'm assuming that these IPs wouldn't make it easier to download many files.
'Easier' isn't really the point, but yes, I'd say that's a fair assessment, Anon.

Cheers.

# 30
You know, I'd say we have a couple hundred links to videos here, and at least that much from the older board that haven't been reposted here as of yet. We should devise some alternative backups somewhere for all of these once G*ogle higher-ups decide "ALL POTENTIALLY DIY ROBOWAIFU-RELATED CONTENT SHALL BE CANCEL-CULTURED HENCEFORWARD". We all know they eventually will, it's just a matter of time. We should be planning and acting proactively on this Anons.

# 31
>>8442
by 'here', i mean all of /robowaifu/ ofc.

# 32
>>8442
I don't think they can do that, bc these are mostly maker videos. Or at least their motivation to do that isn't high enough. Downloading them should be sufficient for now. BitTorrent would be the easiest way to share the backups, but the IP addresses would be open or VPN/Tor required. I don't know enough about MEGA and such platforms. Something like Freenetproject would be overkill, until it isn't. Some years  ago I2P worked better for file sharing via torrents than Tor.

# 33
>>8444
To a degree, I'd say I broadly agree. However, we explicitly had a few from the 8/robowaifu/ days that ''were'' deleted by Youtube. They weren't explicitly sexual, but obviously ecchi-oriented and provisionally sexdoll/robowaifu capable. For example a Japanese man had created a VR-waifu, with a mechanical masturbation machine synced with the animation. Obviously echii, but fully clothed and the man simply sat near the machine to indicate general usage.

There were (and are) '''far''' more sexual things openly on Youtube. This one was pulled IMO simply b/c it threatened women's stranglehold on sex (that ultimately robowaifus represent to them as well).

This was a pretty well-known example, but there were other ones even more tame pulled as well. Things will get worse for men in general in this whole area in the future as the Marxists and neolibs quadruple-down on their gynocentrism.

# 34
>>8445
That's a valid problem to some extend, but also more a nuisance than a showstopper for development. Also, this is mainly a problem if the owner won't upload it somewhere else by himself (Bitchute, Lbry, ...). MGTOW.tv got their app taken down by Google, btw. However, they're working on extending their site to the whole menosphere, which clearly includes us.

# 35
>>8446
Good points. Maybe we should consider an account on lbry or something? I have literally hundreds of videos at least tangentially-related to robowaifus downloaded over the years (including the one mentioned above of the Japanese guy & his VR-waifu simulator).

# 36
>>8449
I don't know enough about it. Which platform is the best? Are they allowing uploads of vids from someone else? ... LBRY never worked very well on my tablet whenever I tried. One big advantage of YouTube is, that they create vids in different resolutions and one can de- or increase the resolution while watching.

# 37
>>8450
I don't know, but I intend to find out soon. The question isn't whether Y*utube is the most powerful video content delivery system atm, it clearly is. And why they arrogantly flaunt their monopoly, again, ''at the moment''. Many are getting fed up with G*ogle and their shit, and competitive alternatives will arise to replace them if they keep it up. Maybe LBRY is, maybe it'll be someone else. Regardless, we need to ==save everything== of any value to us here as we prepare for the deplatforming that is coming for us.

After watching it I'm still woundering why I saw no one building something alike, though some variants require SLS printed (laser/powder) parts. However, in another case they're using Polymorph  to model things by hand. Two extremes.

That Polymorph stuff is sweet. I'll have to look into obtaining some of it at some point. I'm sort of a natural sculptor. Maybe I can fashion some robowaifu parts that way first, and then make casting molds of them for small production runs on kits, etc.

One other thing to mention Anon, always good to keep '''youtube-dl''' updated regularly:

as YT regularly changes their page interface, (apparently primarily in an attempt to foil youtube-dl users from being able to use the tool).

YT tries to block this kind of download with a

Just wanted to mention, that in some videos the guy is heating up PTFE (Teflon) without giving any warnings or claiming to wear a mask. Just don't do that. Wear a mask, or at lest do it outside, or in a garage where the door and a window or another door is open. Maybe also use a ventilator blowing the fumes away from your work.

I just found out about two Youtubers - 'Thomas Messerschmidt' and 'Hawaiisunfun' who have collaborated together to build a robowaifu called 'SimOne' (clever name!) There is even some code on Github and an article about how she was made in 'Servo' magazine (although to read the whole thing you have to sign up).

At one point in the second video they say that SimOne uses a "WowWee Alive Elvis Animatronic Head" as the base for her own head, which I thought was a really smart move!

>those manic drilling-sequences
kek.

Impoverished men deserve to have robowaifus too. To the extent possible, IMO we here on /robowaifu/ should strive to find ways to economize on the resources needed to construct our robowaifus. And then share everything we know freely ofc. It's one of the reasons I've been working towards designs with very inexpensive construction materials such as drinking straws as structural members. The point is for literally thousands of men around the entire world making literally millions of robowaifus of every form imaginable.

While countries that don't have an abundance of affluent White female liberals won't have ''anywhere near'' the pozz and feminism that we here in the West do, still these men are also burdened by it to. Or soon will be, as the Globohomo tightens it's death-grip on everyone. Men in these countries should be encouraged by us to learn the skills they need to do what they can with what they have.

Thanks for finding & posting this here Anon, appreciated.

Thanks Anon! Dang, this guy is both talented and based. The arm's design and the articulated waldo design are both minimalist 'to-the-point' looking, and very functional as well. I think we would all be wise to study this man's works more closely, particularly his more recent ones such as this arm.

It seems to me this guy has solved the '3-axis problem' for the shoulder pretty handily. Not only is it economical in form, it looks to be practically spot-on in the biomimetics-sense too.

Our friend from therobotstudio is currently putting out live streams about testing his robotic arm and maybe more. I wasn't able to watch it, because I had to try to keep my mind on something else. I assume others might be interested, I'll try to watch it as well sometime:

Oh, this is neat. I had the idea to use flight as a crutch since programming real bipedal walking is so complex. The only problem is that it's so noisy. Maybe with a well-made AI it could learn how to move around gradually  weakening its reliance on flight.

Another Engineered Arts Mesmer video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jTny-MYb4tE



The reason I'm posting this is that, in a comment, they said they've "been thinking about an open-source version!" While the Mesmer platform as it stands might not be fit for robowaifu (way too expensive), having a professionally designed animatronic head to build off of could be a hell of a boost.



Fellow anons, do us all a favor if you don't mind and show Engineered Arts some interest in the open source version!

Thanks Kywy! She's actually quite impressive seeing her in action. I just wish there was a translation of the text, I don't read Moon **yet :^)**.

'''==='''

BTW, it occurs to me that some newer anons here may not know how to download robowaifu videos ahead of time just in case TPTB decide they need to be memory-holed. Better safe than sorry right, Anon? :^)
>Warning: These following instructions are only for you if you are comfortable using the Linux terminal, etc.

So (running on a *NIX, obvs.) run these commands to install '''yt-dlp''' if you haven't yet:
```cpp
sudo curl -L https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/releases/latest/download/yt-dlp -o /usr/local/bin/yt-dlp

sudo chmod a+rx /usr/local/bin/yt-dlp```
You can confirm it's installed by asking it's version afterwards:
```cpp
yt-dlp -v```

It's ''also'' a good idea to:
a) download subtitles
b) download descriptions
c) hide your power-level

Accordingly, here's a handy script you can use for doing all three at once.
>note: Tor is needed for this script to work. You ''do'' have Tor installed on your systems, right Anon?

Change to your home directory:
```cpp
cd ~```
Fire up (neo)vim and create a script file:
```cpp
vim tor_ytdl_retry.sh```
Insert this text and save:
```cpp
#!/usr/bin/env bash
maxtries=10
em="Unable to download webpage: HTTP Error 429: Too Many Requests"

set -o pipefail

while :; do
	{ e=$(torsocks -i yt-dlp -i --write-description --write-auto-sub --write-sub --sub-lang="en" "$@" 2>&1 >&3 3>&- | tee /dev/stderr 3>&-); } 3>&1 && exit
	[ $((--maxtries)) -gt 0 -a "$e" = "$em" ] || exit

done```
This will repeat a failed download if YT gives you a 429 error. Occasionally YT changes error message text (among several other things). If you get a new version of 429, just replace the em="..." above with a copy of w/e it turns out being.

Now make the script executable (user + read/execute permissions)
```cpp
chmod u+rx tor_ytdl_retry.sh```

That's it. You're all set now to run this script from w/e directory. So to grab this video Kywy just linked, you first cd into your robowaifu directory in your Videos folder:
```cpp
cd Videos/RW/```
>you ''do'' have a robowaifu directory in your Videos folder, right Anon?

Then run your new script to DL that video like this:
```cpp
~/tor_ytdl_retry.sh https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7C33JQVZBuY```
(just adapt the URI to w/e video you're grabbing, Anon)

Now that you've got your own personal copy of the video, you can watch it anytime, online or off, like this:
```cpp
mpv '手繋ぎメイドロボット”ましろ”ができるまで　　（2018～2021の記録） [7C33JQVZBuY].webm'```
(again, just adapt the mpv playback command to w/e video ofc)

==SAVE.EVERYTHING.ANON. :^)==

Cheers.

Thanks for the videos Anon.

The ''Byrun'' 'walking' video is rather interesting to me personally. At least Engineered Arts is actually addressing some **just ''some'', mind you** of the complexities involved this ~~miraculous~~'simple' act of kinematics.

They still don't seem to get the importance of keeping mass and slung/thrown weight down. How are they going to power this thing and for how long, lol? But they are obvs going for the military market with their operation (kek at the ''Terminator'' head posed on his table). Shame tbh. 

Still, there is something to be learned by studying their work, we'll just do it smarter & better. :^)

Thanks for this helpful tool!

>>16373

From what I can tell, that robot is designed to be plugged in 24/7. (Judging from its heavy duty frame.) I completely ovelooked it at first due to the obvious mass issues but, that knee mechanism is genuinely worth interesting.
