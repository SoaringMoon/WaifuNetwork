How would one go about merging these two designs? I really would like a clean installation like the first one here dollforum.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=163&t=85274&start=15 but I really like the microphones in the ears and more accurate sound coming from the mouth instead of the top of the skull in  the second one dollforum.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=6&t=121089&start=30 Plus I want to incorpaterate a rasperry pi 4 and this python library here github.com/Гунтhercox/ChatterBot to have her offline and to make any needed adustments easily. Maybe not the most sophisticated programming compared to what some of what I have seen here, but I gotta start somehow. And I don't mind cutting out more holes for charging cables. I also found some tutorials on how to make speaker amplifiers so I would be able to direct the speaker to her mouth better. I would have just asked on the doll forum, but you all seem to know your shit better here. Plus opensource is good. If it's not obivious, I am new to this and just trying to learn by doing.

Hey there Anon.

Well, I'd say you probably should start with an original design of your own, and then use these two references as inspirations. So for example, make some drawings first, then try out different ideas. Remember, the concept stage (ie, the one you're at now) is '''always''' the cheapest and best place to make design changes. Start now thinking through all the things you'd like to have in a robowaifu, then begin to sketch those out. Not only are sketches the best way for others (ie, us here on /robowaifu/) to understand what you're going for better, they are also a great way for you to get your own thoughts together for an idea.

>Plus I want to incorpaterate a rasperry pi 4 and this python library [for chat]
Good choice. The Pi4 should have enough power to run the software. We have a text-to-speech thread here, so that might give you some ideas about adding an actual voice to her, otherwise you'll need to type in responses on a computer.

>but I gotta start somehow. 
Quite true, we all start somewhere. Always better sooner rather than later right? :^)

Yes, you'll need some basic tools like a drill and jigsaw or something. For the shells, one guy seems to be using a molded plastic, and the other seems to be using fiberglass layup. You'll need a basic approach to creating the shell. I think we have a plastics fabrication thread here somewhere. Can you sculpt? That can make the process go better if you can.

Welcome to /robowaifu/ Anon. Hey we've all been there, you'll get it, just don't stop and be patient with yourself. This takes time.

Thanks for the welcome and input. I will be getting familiar with the text to speech thread. But the library I linked has options for a custom tts voice.

I pretty much just want something simple that can be upgraded over time and I only want to focus on the head for now. Later I want to add digital screen eyes. Since my drawings are the artistic equivalant of a doctor's handwriting, here is a quick and sloppy ms paint diagram of how I want to start. I used the Aotume Chii love doll as the base to stay in spirit of this board.

As for the actual construction of the shell, I am thinking of trying to 3d print something. I would welcome a plastics fabrication thread personally. I just want something not sloppy looking inside if it can be avoided.

Also not decided on a speaker yet. I want something small and I don't mind making a sound amplifier to move the sound where it needs to be. Isn't it possible to shape pvc pipes with a heat gun for that?

YW.
>has voice
Oh I see, I missed that. That's a pretty stable library iirc so you should be good.
> upgraded over time 
Yep. Every one of us that have managed something irl have done so a little at a time.
> I would welcome a plastics fabrication thread personally

Darn. It was one of the bigger threads from the 8ch days, so it hasn't been moved over here yet.  Sorry about that. :/
The basic gist is: research hollywood prop fabricators techniques. You'll find easy to reproduce techniques for making vacuum-molded plastic parts and other ideas. I can probably pull much of it from off the top of my head for you if you have any particular questions on the topic.
> Isn't it possible to shape pvc pipes with a heat gun for that?
Yes, but use great ventilation anytime you're heating plastics ofc.
>as the base to stay in spirit of this board.
Nice. You could do far worse, but ofc cater to your own tastes Anon. :^)
>also
m-mind sharing that base reference pic alone? i need it for, umm, science-y reasons tbh.

Thanks, I can't actually get to that through TOR unfortunately.

BTW, when I was searching for the images myself, I found this faceup video for a small Chii knockoff. The face looks more like a little goblin than Chii but the woman doing the painting is fairly talented. Might give you some ideas about finishing.

In essence various mold-pouring, sculpting-then-vacuum-pressing approaches were discussed. Most of the examples debated came in one way or other from the film prop-making industries. One of our guys made some attempts at hand-crafted molds first, then went with 3D-printed molds instead along with filing/finishing by hand after extraction. My personal choice was the vacuum-forming mold approach. I've gotten as far as the heating/vacuuming chamber set up, but then I moved across the country and haven't made much progress since, focusing more on software side of things. But it's still a promising approach to creating cheap, easily-reproducible planar plastic parts and one that would be well suited to a small factory runs of robowaifu kit shell parts.

I can't seem to find the exact examples we used but here are a couple of minor related ones that should get you pointed in the right direction.

Those aren't actually very good examples Anon. If I come across them again I'll post the links in the Plastics thread and relink here in yours. ''Real soon now''™ we should have migration tools that will let me bring my board dump here to julay in an automated fashion. You can check that thread out then.

What is the molded plastic good for? Again as a mold for silicone? If not, why would you prefer plastic? It's okay if some are more into more robot-like waifus, but you're mentioned Chi, which is rather human-like.

Basically, because it's a good, relatively inexpensive way to create large pieces for robowaifus, and much cheaper for several pieces in a small factory-run than 3D-printing them (even if you have a printer that can print big enough). And even relatively smaller pieces, for example Chii's 'ears', can be good candidates for molded plastic.

Basically, it's primarily about economy.
