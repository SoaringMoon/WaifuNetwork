The decades-old medical field of prosthetics has already leveraged untold hours of research, billions of dollars of financing, and yuge levels of both clinical and field trials.

Might be a good idea to look to this area for inspiration and ideas for RoboWaifus as well.

While looking for bionic hands I found some open-source files, which I believe were used as a base for the Hero Arm >>9690

Nice find Anon, thanks. Looks like they've gone through a progression to arrive at the current design.

Wow, just wow. And they are open-sourcing this too? /robowaifu/ you should get all over this.

Thanks Anon, makes me want to go work with this company.
