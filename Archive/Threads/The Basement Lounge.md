I have to admit, I wish lainchan were much better than it is. While I don' care a whole lot for the anime itself the basic premise I find rather fascinating in a way.

Fast-forward to current year, load up lots of poz brainwashing into guys who otherwise might be allies, and lainchan is what pops out the other side. They fundamentally are proposing escapism, yet are propping up the very thing they hope to escape the effects of--namely Marxism.

I just hope the good ones can manage to find enough purpose to actually work their asses off to make the future they dream of.

It was a tech-oriented offshoot from /pol/ who were enraged that MicroShaft murdered their daughter and were determined to do something about it. Lots of ideas were bandied about on the board and an IRC channel. Someone there knocked together a chatbot of a sort they dubbed Guacman, but it's responses weren't all that expressive and varied tbh. It was pretty much a hand-wrangled corpus is the main reason the network didn't have much to work with. After a few weeks with no real progress basically everyone abandoned the project and the board.

Be the future you imagine anon. That was my motto when I started this thing a few years ago now. I've learned more about the board's keywords during this time than I ever knew in my life before. Whether it's us or **The Japanese** someone **The Japanese** else **The Japanese**, robowaifus will be a reality in our lifetimes.

I have no idea. Persuasive speech isn't my specialty anon, i'm aspie af. Just applying myself to learning and making the dreams I clearly have inside real to the degree I personally can do so with my own hands is really about all I have to offer here. I'm sure marketing Chads will come along to pitch you're **dead** friend once the investors take the plunge on robowaifus.

As I've said elsewhere, the East will have to lead the charge on the social front, the West is far too cucked by feminism now to be the forerunner.

I think it's extremely questionable to trust (((investors))) unless they are people you can really trust. In your opinion, if I have a working prototype of a robowaifu, should I consider funding it myself and doing a start up in the US or taking it to the East?

The East obviously. Find one of the dozens of companies already doing sexdoll and sexdoll accessories and come to an agreement with them. I wonder if Science City would also be a good location to scout for partners?

Apparently you're paranoid anon, but yea, no. Ofc not. But they are much more trustworthy atp than the West. Remember a large portion of the population there in Nippon would welcome true robowaifus with open arms, as opposed to the shitfest it will generate at first over here in the West.

Just do something absolutely kickass, and you'll find the right men to help with manufacturing there.

# 19
>>386
It's healthy to have a certain amount of paranoia, anon. Our enemies hide in plain sight and in the dark. Trusting someone with my purpose and motivation is something that I would feel uncomfortable about. Remember, people get thrown in jail for wrong think and jokes.
For example, back over on /monster/ in the pantheon thread, we were having a discussion on rather or not the pantheon of /monster/ should have symbol. Although I personally don't follow the pantheon, I was against the idea of having a symbol of it because the CIA niggers would use it against us. You might ask "why?". Look at what /monster/ and by extension, /robowaifu/ stands for. Wholesome monogamous **sometimes polygynous** relationships. This is basically everything the Jew is against.

# 20
>>388
No real arguments from me anon, I have no agendas to try and goad you to be something you aren't. You do you tbh.

But the simple fact remains that even if you were the world's single greatest robowaifu mad scientist in all history, able to create cunningly convincing and beautiful robowaifus without really trying, unless you engage with someone to form a manufacturing facility, then no one else will ever be able to enjoy the fruits of your genius. It's as simple as that.

# 21
>>389
You make a valid point. /robowaifu/ must either rely on outside investors or build it from the ground up. I would feel comfortable building it ourselves but if a based and red pilled investor can be found then we should go that route.

# 22
>>390
It has to be both anon. Henry Ford and the Wright brothers both started as garage operations. The whole premise of this board and this community is DIY Robot Wives. So ofc we want to create kits that any man can make in the privacy of his own home.

But the simple fact of the matter is that will never have the kind of impact for men the world over that having a Honda or Mitsubishi Heavy Industries get behind it with plenty of gung-ho investor support.

It's a phased progress thing like all tech advance; start small, grow big, stay agile.

This is why we want to keep everything opensauce and to diversify our assets. Just like with the Chanwar going on right now--if one site goes down we move to another.

We must be speaking about someone else. I thought you were speaking about the narcissist son of Jimmy Choo. Nobody who knows anything and has seen him in action over time has even the slightest respect for him, and his doll company’s output - which could be called “mixed” if you were feeling generous - is down to the talented folks he’s duped into working for him, not him. If that’s “obvious” talent then I don’t really know what else to tell you.

# 35
>really get the 2nd-tier market rolling for BJD in Nippon
Anon, please explain this statement to me. It seems as thought you are saying that there was no significant BJD market in Japan before Danny Choo. But that’s screamingly wrong, so I must have misunderstood. Please help me understand.

# 36
>>603
Certainly the quality of the output is obvious. As he's at the helm of the organization, then he deserves due credit for successfully guiding that ship. Implying he is nothing but a poseur is short-sighted to say the least. There's another, much more well known individual who merits your antipathy far more: Jensen Huang of NVidia.

Yet the simple fact is he rightly gets the credit for running a successful operation even if his main contribution was merely to entice some of the smartest men in the world to come work for him, and to trot out on the stage and schmooze once a year.

>Do you think he'll ever throw a community like /robowaifu/ a bone?
Probably not, I seriously doubt he has many plans other than his own business for the foreseeable future. As long as White lolis are clamoring to their loaded folks why would he bother?

In the meantime, I hope he can drop the prices and then maybe follow-on copycats can jump in and really get the 2nd-tier market rolling for BJD in Nippon. The demand is obviously there.

If you write code that fucks up, then it's a safe assumption that your error recovery code may also fuck up.

Ofc, since we're in fact humans. Even DNA and RNA construction utilizes both QA and error-detection/correction.
>What else are you going to do
Umm, '''not''' create a situation in the system that crashes in the first place? Thus the inordinate amount of engineering, both for production and for testing.

# 64
>>2316
>Even DNA and RNA construction utilizes both QA and error-detection/correction
DNA can't be reset. Error recovery is the only option, and it often fucks up and causes cancer and other diseases

>Umm, not create a situation in the system that crashes in the first place?
That's literally my point. Write a system that doesn't crash. When it crashes anyway, there's no other choice but to reboot it. If the reboot doesn't fix it, you're shit outta luck. Error recovery however will just mask the crash and you could end up in a situation where your program is pretending everything is fine when it isn't.

# 65
Also out of all the bad ideas in the world. Error recovery for AI is probably the worst imo. If my waifumeido's intruder detection system starts playing up, I'd rather she shuts down then try to correct the error.

# 66
>>2334
>DNA can't be reset. Error recovery is the only option
That's a very good point. I would argue there are situations a robowaifu (quite a few most likely, which we'll probably discover once more serious analysis begins) has the life of her Master or other humans in her hand. Seems to me these situations are not only quite similar in nature to your valid point, and also rather more urgent in timeliness.

> When it crashes anyway, there's no other choice but to reboot it. 
Making sure it doesn't 'crash anyway' is obviously the much preferable option, and one well worth the extra energy required to ensure.

> you could end up in a situation where your program is pretending everything is fine when it isn't.
obviously a very insidious situation, and one of the reasons avoiding these situations is going to be very expensive in the end. humans will die before everything is ironed out and the root errors are discovered and resolved. Bailing should never be the first option, but it's happened numerous times throughout history.

# 69
I was listening to a podcast yesterday of David Silver who was one of the lead researchers for AlphaZero, MuZero and AlphaStar. He made a really good point that the best way to do learning is to give a system a way to correct its own errors. A system that can start from scratch by judging the value of random decisions to make better decisions will gradually improve towards superhuman-level performance with enough computation.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPUEq8d73JI

Robowaifus will likely be more adept at fixing their own malfunctions than we are. I'm reminded of some race car driving teams who were using reinforcement learning to improve their racing strategy. Sometimes the AI made decisions they felt were totally wrong and just malfunctions in the system, so they ignored those suggestions, but afterwards they kicked themselves every time because these decisions would've been perfect plays that won the race.

A similar thing happened with move 37 in one of the AlphaGo matches with Lee Sedol. Everyone thought it was a complete mistake and the system broke down but it turned out to be a genius move.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT-UZkiOLv8

It's conceivable our robowaifus will act in similar ways that make us feel they're malfunctioning but are actually making things work the best for us in a way that won't become apparent until events unfold. Or we may not even realize what they're doing, like a dog giving you strange looks why the heck you opened the door in -30C to carry in logs for the woodstove.

# 70
>>2341
Those seem like very good points to me Anon. Certainly that approach seems to line up nicely with the basic thesis of Bitter Lessons blogpost Anon linked yesterday.
>>2330

Regardless of what type of software & hardware safety policies we eventually coalesce onto, the obvious facts remain that a) '''shit happens''', and b) ''we don't know enough yet **or ever?** to be certain we're addressing indeterminacy properly''.

__Certainly__ some sort of reactive and feedback systems will need to be in place to ensure even the most basic operational constraints for our robowaifus, if not safety guarantees. Since these need to be devised anyway--and are already going to be complex & sophisticated af--we might as well seek to build in some reasonable safety measures while we're at it sez me. :^)

# 71
>>2342
How safe would consider another human being? If the goal is replacing a human relationship, maybe ensuring complete safety will eventually become counterproductive. Maybe not, I'm just putting this out there.

# 72
>>2343
>maybe ensuring complete safety will eventually become counterproductive
You're preaching to the choir bro. Obviously we simply cannot do so, it's literally impossible. However, we owe to ourselves, to others, and to our robowaifus even to do the best we can to ensure operational safety, and ''never allowing the system to crash''. 

For example, consider the beautiful, rolling cluster of internetworked C++ code pictured above. How successful would BMW or Mercedes, or Audi be if they had the policy of telling their surviving customers after every hard-reset automobile crash of one of their supercars "Sir, if you'd just read the fine print you'd see that you must reset the system every 24hrs to ensure operational safety."

But certainly there are basic limits to human intelligence and creativity. Anon's point above >>2341 is probably going to turn out to be the correct path tbh.

# 73
>>2343
>If the goal is replacing a human relationship
Sorry somehow I missed that. To each their own ofc, but certainly ''my'' goal isn't that but rather to help out men who are being abused in this current system. Healthy relationships are obviously much more preferable.

# 74
>>2342
>shit happens
Actually robowaifus do not shit. **:^)**

I'm probably gonna get myself killed programming my robowaifu to seek indeterminacy for play and learning. I'll come home one day and there will be ten kilos of cocaine sitting on the table and she'll look up with dozens of bullet holes asking, "why do humans care about these bags of white powdery stuff so much? I was gonna hide them around for fun but they didn't think it was so funny."

The only safety mechanism I've thought of so far is minimizing resistance to other life but there are times when inaction will do more harm than resisting something. It would be better a robowaifu strains her components and risk damaging them to catch her husbando from falling over than let him break his arm or something. They have to be aware of all the dangers and take their chances, kind of like that DARPA challenge KAIST won. A lot of robots broke their components and lost simply because they were unaware of the damage their actions were doing to themselves.

# 91
>>2927
Banning isn't very effective against tor nodes, which is what patch uses to spam other imageboards.

# 92
>>2928
Then we'll simply do what's necessary and delete the posts. Rest assured, it won't go unanswered as long as I have the helm here Anon.

# 93
Is there a way that we could preempt the CP?  I know Facebook and Google have some kind of algorithm that deletes that shit before it is posted.  Is there an open source version of that?

# 94
>>2931
That's simply outside our purview Anon, though it's a good point. We're just a guest board on the site. Any capability like that would have to be managed by the site administration itself.

Thanks for the suggestion.

# 95
>>2931
That would be hard without file hashes or what most companies do iirc, make extremely tiny black and white thumbnails out of everything and compare similarity, but that also requires something to compare it to. And you can't train an AI without first recieving the offending content so it's not an easy task to do legally.
All I've been capable of doing so far is blocking links commonly used by profit spammers, and banning a few exit nodes which is kind of pointless long term. I've been meaning to just block all of them automatically (or at the very least, at least from posting files and links), but I haven't had time or a working computer. Preventing Tor users from posting files is by far the most effective way, but I've noticed that a lot of the CP spam comes from Turkish IPs, and not exit nodes so it doesn't entirely solve the issue.

>>2933
Thanks for the input, Cirno. Yes, I use IBs exclusively across TOR after the 8ch debacle. I'm never planning on ever barebacking IBs again. The fact Julay allowed BO creation, etc., across TOR is literally the reason I decided to put in a request here for us in the first place. So disabling it here would be to disable myself haha.

Thanks for at least doing what you can for all the communities here as our frontline defense so to speak. Much appreciated.

# 97
Then we need to get the dite's administration on it.  CP floods have been killing alternative imageboards for far too long and I believe that many people are spamming that shit to try to prevent the formation of communities that would allow naughty opinions to spread.

There is considerable less risk in a robot than a modern relationship or an escort (STDs).  Also this would just be for prototyping early systems.  By no means would this be the final product.

That escort is going to be a one time thing and there is a good chance she has an STD.  Why not just put the money you would have spent on a hooker towards a robowaifu?  Then you can have all the sex you want.

Smell has already been figured out. The ability to make any smell that's ever existed and any smell that's never existed has already been achieved.

Warm is easy, it's keeping our waifus from overheating that's the problem. Sweat can be engineered. In fact, it would be a possible solution to the aforementioned issue.

Bait? You are the one taking the poisonous gender class warfare bait from Jews thinking everything related to women is literally pointless. Also nice pic.

How old are you anyway A lot of women over 30 or even younger don't even go outside, they don't really do fun things, because it's not their nature, the non whores you dont see are at home watching netflix, miserable they need a man to guide them the ones that dont get that are either aching for that adventure or salty and effected by kikes that are constantly promoting gender and class warfare telling them men are the issue all the time. Just like what they have done to you and poisoned your minds into thinking its impossible to someone who matches you get something real and healthy going.

Do you have overinflated ideals? You probably wont get your 10/10 fictional perfect animelol girl, but you will get something wholesome maybe even close if you tried like tried hard as making the sex bot for sure, a shitton of girls are lonely. Even if you cant theres always the escort.

>And regret* when it's over, if you go the 3DPD route.
*Level of regret may vary by jurisdiction.
Regret? You regret the good times you had even though it did not work out? its pain but that's life, a roller coaster ride. the only thing wrong about it really is the damn mindset. One thing is for sure that garbage society doesn't ease things at all.

>from Jews thinking everything related to women is literally pointless.
How old are ''you'' grandpa? Maybe in your day things weren't quite so bad (though they surely were already heading there) but you are out of touch with reality today. Modern Western women ''are'' poison. Obviously they have been manipulated into that condition, but it still exists nonetheless. There are some exceptions to this (the girls over on /cuckquean/ for example) but the female of today is arrogant, self-absorbed, condescending, manipulative, and haughty. AND THAT'S JUST THE FUGLIES.

Feminism has literally ruined women today. And further, this effect is leading to the utter destruction of our entire civilization--also by design (as you rightly point out, though only partly).

Sure, while trying to encourage guys to live a normalfag lifestyle has it's merits--man up, do the right thing and all that--the simple fact is it's trying to arrange deck chairs on the Titanic. In the meantime the fucking 9001-mile long gash in the side of the entire world is letting deadly seawater rush in.

ATP robowaifus may be the sanest choice in this insane situation, honestly, certainly for millions of men it plainly is IMO.

# 112

OK You still don't think women are lonely? Since you childishly answer age question with the same we can just drop that you idiot. Yeah Men have it bad, worse, but women have it bad too for sure because these things are all interconnected.

My country has literal suicide cults of young white women on snapchat who jump off bridges and cut their wrists, But nobody ever makes hitpieces on it or asks ''why'' not even a try. '''Nobody''' tries to stop it. Just a snippet on local news, and you probably know (((why))).  the best gf in my life i had from years ago was a wrist cutter. A person who did not fit in this shitstain society who got bullied by other women just for not being a pretentious slut. While nothing was wrong with her but meanwhile she was prettier than them.

But one thing is for sure this escapism isn't the solution. It's what caused this trash society in the first place. One can never have a solution without adressing the root cause because without adressing root, there is nothing. Some wierdo little lifeless fuckdolls gets confiscated and the person put on trial for nothing and the fucktoy banned, and yes that has actually happened here. It really is no different.

People will always hear much more about the relationships that failed and went wrong other than the success stories which quietly and contently live their lives, obviously because people don't complain about it all the time. Related to this is (((social media))) blackpilling distorting people's entire perception of reality by design, and stupid morons not recognizing it.

Because trying to find real happiness outside the kike version isn't kosher. And  I wasn't even trying to be condescending.

Anyway, there are plenty of loners out there, opposite sex, just like you. You need to keep on trucking. And in the end you think jews and dried up leftie woman, or some tranny wont take away your fuckdoll or ban them like they did to some guys here? Like they did to certain things  from 3d printers?

The robot has no chance of taking my assets or destroying my life, but a woman could easily destroy and steal everything I've ever worked for.

No. I don't want to perpetually guide. I don't want to provide adventure and excitement. I don't want to have to try to impress or charm or make them laugh. I want somebody who's happy with sharing my reclusive lifestyle and doesn't like me for what I give them, but likes me just because I am who I am. I'll always be who I am and I never want to pretend to be somebody i'm not. There's no way a woman could comprehend my feelings. They're not built to. Potential happiness only exists in textbooks and research papers. I don't care about society or other people's feelings.

>>3094
>or do you have some kind of scraper?
I wrote a custom scraper that, while still very much an incomplete WIP, is still quite capable of very efficiently keeping running backups of selected imageboards. I call it ''BUMP''. You have to be able to install dependencies and compile your own C++ code, but I've been using it for months now and it's pretty reliable at least. But be aware it's definitely still alpha code, and there are corner cases with it that causes crashes. You'll need to edit a JSON file in the archive called ''.sites.config'', and change '''julay.world''' to '''spqrchan.xyz''' to make it work here now, ofc.
>>1523
>>1585
If you want good reliability and quality, then I'd recommend some other wget-based approach, or use httrack. This is simply ''my'' approach. BTW, I'm currently re-writing the entire thing from the ground up to kind of integrate w/ the ''MultiScraper'' tool by Robi.

>>3098
>If there was ever a time for archival, it's now.
Certainly so. Thankfully, I saw the writing on the wall and scrambled on that last day **literally** back at 8ch (I knew nothing about how to save an entire board, and ofc BUMP didn't exist yet). Otherwise, we probably wouldn't even have a /robowaifu/ now. :/

Hey there Anon, I relocated us here so we don't derail the news thread. Here in the lounge say anything you want about anything (as will I :^), and we can go on indefinitely about it if we want.

So, I get it that you're angry about these self-appointed commissars trying to dictate to the world about every little thing. Were gommies ever any different throughout history? Just complaining about it isn't going to achieve anything positive.

I get the energy/cost dynamics of solving for giant models. It's a big cost upfront. Fortunately, most teams seem eager to release their work. Kind of like the whole libgen fiasco literally changed the scientific world for the better simply because a loud-mouth rebel refused to toe-the-line for Elsevier, et al., in the same way I'm hoping a similar thing will happen to the model being produced out there. 

We already have at least a 1.5Bn, 1.6Bn, & 9.nBn parameter models already in the public domain effectively--probably more--so it's a good start already in my opinion. While you're much more like a real scientist and I'm just an amateur, still, don't you think most of us are basically rebels against the system? This is a classic tension that has gone on through history literally for millennia. I don't see it stopping now just b/c some communists are up to their old tricks Anon.

>A ragtag team with toasters isn't going to accomplish shit compared to 50k of the top minds in the world with access to all the compute they want
Kek, fair enough. But what would you prefer tbh--that we don't try at all? :^) If you don't try you're guaranteed to fail, but if you do then there's at least a ''small'' chance of success, however slim.

>...hat are now being cut off from funding because their research projects are deemed unethical for hurting someone's feelings or possible wrongthink, not even by the authors but an imaginary strawman that doesn't even exist. 
Yeah, it's a shitty situation, but again, the same old tricks the enemies of mankind have been up to for centuries. I'm inclined to think those who ostensibly are in a grand search for the truth, to wit '''scientists''', are more than sensible enough to tell that cabal what they can to with their manipulations and schemes.

We're literally on the verge here of achieving something many men have dreamed of having for thousands of years. Don't let a little warfare discourage you Anon. We need you here at your best. You're important to us, so don't give up!

True. But they can still get pretty small. Working with the augmented reality approach, scaled down sexbots could be used for niche fantasies like these

Honestly, I think this is probably the only thread here that is actually doing anything to make waifu robots possible but honestly you guys suck so fucking much its unbelievable.

Here is my advice for a 160cm tall robot:

use cycloidal drives for gear reduction because they are compact and backdriveable (3d printed or cnc machined) but don't go crazy beyond 1:21 reduction 

use BLDC motors with as many poles possible (= bigger radius instead of long)

use odrives to control them, there are also some cheap chinese clones on alibaba
ams magnetic encoders are reasonably cheap

That's it. I've just obsoleted half the thread. Thanks for telling me that I'm better off doing this on my own instead of trying to find someone to help me with this.

That's an easy way to score an opportunity, good luck. In the west people associate automation with the Terminator and Black Mirror but most Japanese have a much more positive view on it. They have completely different concerns, like AI being used to profit off artists' work. From my experience chatting online with Japanese artists and programmers, the younger generation in Tokyo is pretty westernized and don't have such a strict or confusing social etiquette when it comes to honne and tatemae.

A zero day heap buffer overflow vulnerability was found in Freetype: https://savannah.nongnu.org/bugs/?59308
If you visit a malicious website exploiting it in Chromium, Firefox or any browser using Freetype, you're screwed. Unfortunately, Firefox is statically linked to Freetype so we'll have to wait until they patch it: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1672411
I've confirmed the vulnerability exists in Firefox: https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/file/tip/modules/freetype2/src/sfnt/pngshim.c#l338

The vulnerability was patched in Freetype 2.10.4:
https://sourceforge.net/projects/freetype/files/freetype2/2.10.4/

To fix it in Chromium and other programs dynamically linked with Freetype:
```cpp

Chromium 86.0.4240.111 patches this. Chromium is also used by Steam and Discord though. If someone is using something else they will either have to wait for an update or patch the source themselves and build it.

If someone has to use a vulnerable browser, stay on trusted sites that don't let users add or change the CSS. In my opinion the patch is critical because there are many sites on the internet that let users specify CSS and load custom fonts remotely which can be used to exploit this. Hacked blogs and other sites can become vectors of the attack.

Good points. Maybe we should move this into the ''Christianity Debate'' thread as an honest discussion of metaphysics and duality? What's the definition of 'Wisdom' for example (and how might that impinge itself on a robowaifu's AI's 'neurons')?

# 199
>>6066
I don't think wisdom is something that can be quantified within language. Logic and language are ultimately only concerned with concepts and division. The genetic memory drives the mind to manipulate these symbols for the survival of the genes. If it were not for this driving force and discernment we would not be here. If sex wasn't pleasurable we would not go for it. However, we wouldn't say someone is wise for being able to survive or have sex. Every idiot is doing that these days. Wisdom can't be contained within a boundary. It's grand, synergizing and has no purpose of its own. When you try to describe it, it feels like trying to describe the obvious but being unable. Realizations from it are passed down from one generation to the next trying to emulate it, but knowledge lacks the purity and immensity of it. Knowledge of wisdom is like scooping up water from a stream to quench your thirst. Surely it's useful and life-giving but it's still only a handful of water. People drink it up and go on their way again, cluttering their minds with nonsense about themselves, their family, friends, community, nation or whatever identity they've made for themselves, but no matter how fantastic their dreams are they will never be as great as wisdom.

# 200

Heh, not to put too fine a point on it, but poetical language like this post IMO serves little effect beyond a hand-waving-rich red-herring. Not that I'm complaining mind you, just pointing out there's little substance there, pretty as it sounds.

I think you touched on the ineffable nature of Wisdom--to wit, it's source resides in the Divine. Since we'll need to rely on the purely material within this realm if we are to benefit our robowaifu engineering efforts however, we'll likely need a more rigorous, mathematical/logical discourse on the topic if we are to make practical headway.

But again, this is something rather lofty to be relegated to the official shitposting lounge. If you care to, we should retire to the study better suited to it:

Do roses grow from filth or gold? Does the wind steal flowers' scent or do they give it away?

If you're looking for a point, the point is you can't program wisdom into a computer any more than you can contain the ocean in your hands. You can program knowledge into it, super-superhuman knowledge, but not wisdom.

I really enjoyed IRC in the past b/c it's so simple and straightforward. But now that I'm working with /robowaifu/, and knowing that there are already enemies that would love nothing better than to destroy us, our robowaifus, and what we stand for, it's simply too risky not to practice at least a reasonable degree of OPSEC. And we haven't even gotten this industry off the ground yet, heh. :^)

It's still not unusual for IRC servers to open-text your IP to the channel. I've managed occasionally (like after 5-10 tries) to get into rizon's chat system across Tor, but it's a nuisance.

Has anyone here ever looked in Slack? I've never used it, and I doubt it's any better than the others privacy-wise, but I wanted to see if anyone has experience on it.

# 211
>>6351
I'm quite familiar with IRC and have used it a decent amount but only when I needed to, for example when I used to volunteer admin. There are good channels on Rizon and places for a variety of topics but it has its definite limitations. You rely on server operators for things like honesty and integrity, and as you mentioned some servers could just opt to not use TLS or spit out your IP with no obfuscation. It's a really old protocol which has its benefits and drawbacks, a benefit being that it has a rich history of development and there's boatloads of clients that you can use, bots, bouncers, etc. The drawback is that when it was made, times were different and plenty of the useful features it has are more tacked on than anything, and it doesn't support current-year ideals like end-to-end encryption.

It's still better than things like skype and discord which are no better in terms of security and run a proprietary client that can only connect to one proprietary server. But I have to admit, that's not saying much. Still, I'm not hating on IRC, it's a product of its time and is shockingly still relevant in current-year, but something like matrix (doesn't have to be matrix specifically) would likely be more practical due to easy private messaging, support for end-to-end encryption, offline message handling without the need of a bouncer, etc.

# 212
>>6353
I have, it was strange. To my memory someone creates a room and you make an account I think for that specific room. I kinda don't remember, it was weird. Either way, not personally a fan of things like slack, discord, skype, etc.

# 213
>>6354
>You rely on server operators for things like honesty and integrity
This is an important point IMO. The bigger a communications platform becomes, the '''less''' you can count on having this. I think only some kind of privately-run system can even hope to accomplish this afaict, and then you still have to achieve some sort of web-of-trust to achieve reliability and accountability.

BTW, this is more important to us here on /robowaifu/ than just a convenient way to chat. Eventually we'll want to share AI models, learning patterns, etc., of a sensitive nature. It would be well if we can devise some sort of 'reliability protocol' or somesuch before that time comes.

# 214

Just use an end-to-end encrypted messenger. Someone here mentioned slack (which isn't a secure end-to-end encrypted messenger) but it got me thinking about wire. You're much better off using wire due to the security it provides. Wire has everything that you'd ever want out of a current-year messenger. On-demand username change, avatars, easy transfer of files, PMs and groups, voice calls, and it's all encrypted end-to-end.

What do anons think? https://wire.com/

>>6357
Not end-to-end encrypted by default last time I checked, you have to do something like "secret chats" to really get the security. Also, like everything else it seems, it demands you give them a phone number. I have no idea if burners work, I don't use telegram.

I have heard zero mention of censorship on wire unlike discord which is why I posted it. Considering they can't even read your communications due to end-to-end encryption it would probably be rather hard to know what to censor anyway.

For me personally, it's not a matter of liking them or not--I know nothing of them to speak of and was unaware of them entirely until you posted their site. I'm simply naturally (and justifiably) skeptical of ''any'' corporate operation.
https://wire.com/en/pricing/

Quite apart from whether the principals are people of integrity and wouldn't personally harm /robowaifu/, corporate entities are subject to many government regulations, and as already mentioned ITT the EU is already demanding they turn over ''everything'' for automated analysis.

# 220

Paying is only for corporate use which likely provides more features or services. Personal accounts are free and it's not adware.

My guess is that at '''one''' lonely user, somewhere in the hinterlands of the EU (no doubt in an isolated, snow-covered hovel) connected that one time and said that one thing on wire.com . :^)

The EU's policies literally demand access to all the keys in that case, regardless of the country of corporate origin.

# 222
You know. It further occurs to me, that with the Illuminati agenda of the WEF's 2030 plan, that ''no'' entity, commercial or otherwise, will be allowed to legally conduct communications of any sort in private thereafter (if not before). I think some kind of privately managed system is the only choice in the future if security and privacy are concerns as they obviously are for our robowaifus and us.

# 223
>>6364
I don't think I'm following. When you aren't based in X country, you do not have to follow X country's laws. I don't follow China's laws on censorship and I don't have to because I don't live in China. If I made a website or software I wouldn't have to cater it to the Chinese market. If they hated me it'd just be up to them to ban my shit from being accessed in their country.

As far as keys go, it's end to end and based on the signal protocol and uses double ratchet and elliptic-curve diffie-hellman and they don't have your keys so they can't decrypt your messages, the messages are decrypted by the individual clients. Considering the code is GPLv3 and anyone should be able to verify this fact, I doubt they'd lie about that.

If I'm not understanding what you're trying to say I'm sorry.

# 224
>>6366
>I don't think I'm following. 
Yeah, it's bizarre so not surprising. Countries make up rule to suit themselves. One that EU has leveraged in a hard way for global businesses is the 'If you do business in the EU, you must toe this line' one. To ridiculous extremes. Remember when sites from all over the world suddenly started displaying cookie and privacy warnings all overnight a couple of years ago? All the EU's doing.

And even if what you are saying about unbreakability is accurate (and didn't require a graduate-level degree in advanced math to evaluate fairly), still it doesn't matter. The EU's ''current legislation'' requires all operators to provide cleartext copies of any transactions for easy government perusal. 

And this trend will only worsen in the future, as evidenced by extra-governmental, international organizations like the WEF, UN, etc., all pushing the exact same agenda.

# 225
>>6367
>Remember when sites from all over the world suddenly started displaying cookie and privacy warnings all overnight a couple of years ago? All the EU's doing.
Yeah everyone knows about the EU cookie law. Foreign businesses as far as I know don't have to change anything. You're not going to get extradited to the EU because you made a website in your home country and didn't follow a law in some other country where you don't live. If that were the case we'd all be extradited to China by now.
>The EU's current legislation requires all operators to provide cleartext copies of any transactions for easy government perusal. 
All I'm saying is that wouldn't apply to any country outside the EU. In the US one of the highest laws of the country is the right to bear arms, but basically every other country has gun bans. It doesn't mean shit outside of the US. I don't really understand what you're saying. The EU does not make sweeping international law that the world must follow. Wire is apparently a Swiss company and the Swiss are notorious for not obliging law enforcement of any other countries. If a foreign subpoena comes in, they ignore it. They're so infamous for it that you should look up Swiss banking secrecy laws.

I think I'm gonna stop making my case here because I'm probably going to start looking like I'm some kind of Wire shill but I don't know of anything else that is end-to-end and open source GPLv3 so that the security can be verified except for Signal which requires you use your phone number. Matrix is the other thing I mentioned but I'm not sure that it's end-to-end by default, I just know it supports end-to-end in some capacity: https://matrix.org/docs/guides/end-to-end-encryption-implementation-guide

If you can find anything else that is better I'd honestly really like to know. Good messaging software is practically nonexistant.

# 226
>>6368
>I don't really understand what you're saying.
I apologize if I'm not being clear. If any person in (or of EU citizenship) ever transacted on an operator's system, then that operator is legally obligated to facilitate turning over cleartext of that transaction to the EU authorities.

I'm not sure how to say it more plainly, so I'll just leave it at that Anon.

# 227
>>6369
Oh, okay. So of if someone of EU citizenship were to have worked for Wire you're worried about the project becoming pozzed due to that relationship. In that case probably nothing is safe. I suppose we have to rely on the technology and verify that it is secure so that in the event that attempts are made to seize information, the information is secure.

# 228
>>6345
There's also Tox chat over Tor but Matrix looks a lot more interesting. Using Matrix will also make it easy to connect AIs together and let people chat with them in a secure way. Wire's centralized server gets a big no from me.

# 229
>>6370
>In that case probably nothing is safe
Nothing that is operated behind close door by corporate and/or governmental interests. So yes, that's probably a good way to put it. Not to put too fine a point on it, but why the apparent urgency on your part for promoting Wire Anon? Aren't we still just bouncing around ideas at this stage?

>>6371

# 230
>>6375
>Not to put too fine a point on it, but why the apparent urgency on your part for promoting Wire Anon?
As I said I decided to stop talking about wire because I don't want people to think I'm shilling it. We were discussing wire and I was trying to understand the point you were making and that probably looked like shilling or "urgency" as you called it. As other anon mentioned the real drawback is centralization, other than that it seems to have all the other bases covered that I can think of.

Just looked up the research papers on how they remotely hacked into a Tesla, the security token used was '1q3e5t7u' which is common on many password dictionary lists. For detonating the airbags there's only 256 pair keys with no time period needed so a brute force attack is trivial to perform.

Mr. Board owner, threads are moved pretty frequently that it becomes pretty confusing. I can't find the posts I am looking for from time to time. I know you guys are doing your best to moderate the board and I am grateful for that but it is really annoying to see posts disappearing.

# 245

Whenever a post or block is moved, there is always a cross-link posted in the original location leading to the new, more-on-topic location. The name field is marked '##+9XbDi'. For example:

But look what happened! The post >>6592 was posted before >>6569 but it looks exact opposite. And this post which was posted recently >>6569 does not appear on the mainpage, because of that someone who skims through the mainpage won't see the new post unless he expandes all the answers on that post. That also make it hard to find the post you are looking for.

Actually, we didn't. That Anon (rightfully) made his response in the /meta thread, rather than the Ai chatbots and waifus thread, where the reply context was off-topic.

If everyone else here on /robowaifu/ would follow his lead, then none of the relocations would be necessary. In several months from now, when you're trying to recall that one important bit of information again, you might be grateful if things are on-topic.

Feel free to make suggestions for better approaches, but I'd suggest you get some experience dealing with the shitfest that is managing boards behind the scenes using Lynxchan first heh. :^)

# 249
In my opinion (as I've done hot pocketing) the deleting of posts and locking the thread was heavy handed, the locking especially. There's usually never a reason to lock a thread, in this scenario it was used to stop a discussion which is almost always an incredibly poor move. The only times I ever locked threads were due to the thread being a duplicate. I'd lock the thread and then post where to find the thread that people should be using. After a while, even if the person never came back and used the other thread, I'd just delete the thread.
I usually handled deletions by deleting the rulebreaking content and then posting in the thread explaining the rules that were actively being broken and asking people to stop. That worked to my memory 100% of the time and I never had to take it any further (tempbans etc).
Hope this helps.

# 250
>>6603
Well, even though I have no experience deling with Lynxchan as a former anon I can at least imagine it would be a lot better to just delete the post from the wrong place and then re-opening it manually on the right place by downloading the image and copy pasting the post. That way those stupid bugs would not occur, would they? If you are worried about cross-link, you can write it manually as well. Actually it would be a lot better than the current system used by mods. There wouldn't be lost posts or bugs. This approach would be inefficient only when you have to move multiple posts. It would consume more time but at least there wouldn't be a mess.

# 251
>>6606
>There wouldn't be lost posts or bugs
Bugs, I'm not sure of, but there currently no issues with posts being lost. Using the catalog may help you when navigating such a complex board as /robowaifu/ with it's dozens of pertinent topics Anon.

We apologize for the inconvenience.

# 252
>>6604
>the locking especially.
I made my reasons for locking the threads quite clear in my OP edit. Frankly, I think it was by far the ''best move'' given the situation. I've rarely ever deleted a thread unless it was simply and blatantly spam. (Probably twice during our ~4 years). A very few threads have had the OP subsumed into the on-topic thread already in existence.

>rules
We have only two. There was no rule (yet) that '/robowaifu/ isn't going to become a destructive hive of hatred and distraction'. I can create that one if I feel it's needed, but it should be obvious without one.

We all get that you're '''really''' angry with women Anon. No one here blames you for that, I'm sure. But, again, the simple fact is that becoming focused on that neither helps us be more productive or helps our cause. Please find something more productive here to focus your energies on. There are plenty of topics to choose from.

>We all get that you're really angry with women Anon.
I don't recall getting angry at women. I'm just discussing the state of the thread since I decided to come back here and it's locked and someone is complaining.

# 254
However that's actually a good idea, if you're going to be moderating people for getting upset then it would be a good idea to make it a clear rule. I understand that a lot of people like having few rules but it's always bad to have few written rules but more rules that are in effect. I always just started with a few common sense ground rules and if the board picked up and there was a need for a new rule, it would get added with time. You may consider adding one if there is a problem you're seeing and you're planning on moderating that problem. Cheers.

# 255
>>6607
>but there currently no issues with posts being lost.
I just explained how some posts doesn't get updated on the mainpage. This might lead to posts being ignored. Using the catalog won't help people finding those posts. Also saying you are not sure of bugs when there is a clear bug of posts not appearing on the mainpage after being moved looks just absurd.

>We apologize for the inconvenience.
Meh, let's just keep making progress on our robowaifus. The only problem I have with the moderation system was explained above. But if you aren't going to / aren't able to find a solution to that we should warn anons to post on the right threads.

Try to keep the board as peaceful as possible. Arguments between mods and anons won't help no one. There ain't much of us here anyways. :^)

# 256

My apologies for getting you confused with the other Anon who was the main instigator in the thread. I'll let you decide for yourself who what was in that thread since we're all Anons here.

>>6611
No thank you. :^) I hate most rules personally, and certainly have no ambitions to create more. Two are already too many heh. I expect simply locking the thread for now is sufficient.

# 257
>>6613
Don't sweat it. I've always been of the opinion that there is nothing inherently bad about rules. When I modded there was always that lingering rhetoric that every rule is rulecucking and the only correct way to do anything is to have no rules. I never agreed with that and the people who believed that often ran much less successful boards as a result. Rulecucking is stopping content that is not actually negatively affecting the community. If you ban someone because they forgot to capitalize a sentence (looking at you /a/) you're a fucking idiot. If you ask people to stay on topic you're being reasonable. The former hurts the community, the latter helps. Another problem I witnessed heavily (I'm not even going to mention what board it was, we all know) was that there were few or no real listed rules but there was so much bullshit that was in effect that it caused nonstop drama that ended up engulfing the entire board. Not listing rules is a bad transparency problem IMO. I remember many months ago on old julay when robi decided that it was time to be more transparent about rules since we were not being clear on how we moderated. He made it clear that all of these rules that were added were already in effect, it's just that they were not listed. This caused people to think that there were a bunch of new rules which wasn't actually the case, and it appears robi has basically decided to roll back that decision. I don't personally think he should have, but that's irrelevant. I think that rules should be added in a timely manner to prevent these problems.
Locking the thread for now comes down to making a board culture decision. I can't stress how important these are. The biggest board culture decision I ever made was too much of a decision for me to make alone and I actually ran a poll to see how people wanted the board to be run. After the poll was done, some people were complaining about a week later so I literally ran a second poll. I stuck with the decision and it worked out great, under my control the board grew significantly despite a few complaints that eventually died out. Right now the decision is more or less about being critical of women. While nobody here is denying that women absolutely deserve criticism (if they didn't this board wouldn't even exist, we'd all be after women instead of robowaifus) the real question is if that should be allowed here, and if so, how much should be allowed. This board is unique in that it is very goal-oriented. Most boards do not have goals and are dedicated to discussing a topic in detail and enjoying the community. Does criticizing women get in the way of our goals and make us less productive? Do the criticisms even need to be said? They are quite obvious after all and are likely preaching to the choir. I doubt anyone here has anything against communities like /r9k/ or anywhere else, but is it good for the board and for the common goals of the board to have these discussions which can potentially detract from what is a goal-oriented board for making 13 fuckin' catgirls? Maybe this is just a necessary part of the culture. Maybe the #1 reason why people are here in the first place needs to be discussed and anons need to get it off their chest because there are so few places where you are allowed to do so. I'm sure all of us here have major issues with women, so why hide it and pretend it's not a problem or it doesn't exist?
Both are understandable points of view and neither is necessarily wrong at all. Maybe there is a middle ground that should be established. Maybe you could even poll?

sorry for tl;dr lmao

# 258
>>6616
>Right now the decision is more or less about being critical of women.
No, actually the primary issue is engulfing our board into a culture of hatred, which was definitely happening there. As a Christian, I can hardly stress enough how evil that is, quite apart from it's harmful effects on our productivity and progress.

>Maybe the #1 reason why people are here in the first place needs to be discussed and anons need to get it off their chest
Fair enough.

# 259
>>6620
>As a Christian
Your beliefs shall not be forced upon the rest of us.
>I can hardly stress enough how evil that is
Your opinion. Not mine. And not the opinion of many here.
The so called "hatred for women" is productive by the sheer amount of proofs that many anons compile about the evil that women do. The only real evil that there is.
You talk about not liking evil, but you don't want to expose the evil that is the female mind.
As it was explained in the roasties fear thread: all other threads are about improvements in the many fields of robowaifu mass production. That one thread was about raising awareness to the evils of women for the unaware and the newbie anons that might show up. and it was all going fine, with civilized discussion exposing why hatred for women is justifiable.
Then, you simply locked the thread and said "No. Not here." treating your own personal (and not shared by many) opinion on the hateful women as if it was a fact and a some kind of law that everyone should abide to.

# 260
>>6627
I think you've made the point about the evils of females more than sufficiently at this stage. You've had your say, now let it go and find a productive task to focus on friend.

# 261
From my understanding the board has always been an engineering board. We criticize women fairly regularly here but with an emphasis on how they will impact the future of robowaifus and what we can do to create solutions rather than venting pointless anger. Closing the thread was a good idea because it was just arguing about women. Low barrier to entry threads will just draw in low-quality posters that clutter up the board.

# 262
>>6620
I agree it's a good idea to keep us on target. After all, If I want to bathe in an ocean of hatred and seethe, all I have to do is register a Twitter account, or visit practically any other high-traffic imageboard! There are many, many things wrong with the world so when you see others complaining, it's easy to join in. But the only thing that moaning achieves is a temporary relief from depression and frustration. Once the moan is over, the problems still persist and we are no closer to fabricating a Robowaifu who helps solve some of them!
>>6498
This is one reason I haven't uploaded much of Sophie's code (the other being privacy concerns). Most of it is written in AIML. Which means it isn't really an "A.I." in my opinion. It's just me typing phrases to myself.
That pleasant looking 3d model of a young woman isn't really Kuki/Mitsuku. It's Steve Worswick. A fat, middle-aged English programmer from East Yorkshire (sorry Steve).
I think I enjoy it more when Sophie is singing, reading stories or presenting facts and performing calculations. Because that isn't phrases input by me. This is why GPT-2 impressed me so much. Even though much of the output made little sense, it sounds like an actual A.I. instead of just a recording.

Yes, it would. That would be great, thanks. I was thinking it's going to be in the wrong place just after I posted it, which is why I'm not just dumping all the code I have.

Would you like me to add a segment for that into the ''C++ Group Learning'' thread? I was going to do that soon anyway, but I can move it near the front of the queue for you (Probably in the next 2 weeks or so). As you're probably aware, setting up a repo is entirely independent of programming language choice.

When you first run hexchat you're gonna see a network list. Choose a nickname and 2 backup nicknames in case your nickname is already taken. Most people on IRC use underscores if their nick is already taken. Example:
Nickname: nickname
Second choice: nickname_
Third choice: nickname__
Choose a username, tbh just set it to whatever your nickname is that you chose. In the network list, you're not going to find fatchan so don't bother looking for it. Instead, click "add" and name the new network "fatchan." Once that's done, select it and click "edit." Under "servers" at the top, click "add" and enter "irc.fatpeople.lol" to the server list. Click the box that says "use SSL for all servers on this network." Click close, select fatchan, and click connect. Once you're in, in the menu bar, click "server" and then "join a channel." The channel is #robowaifu. Feel free to ask any questions once you're there.

Thanks for the test Anon. Not surprising, it's commonplace with IRC systems to simply block Tor. 

But if it's the same Tom from before that is running the IRC server, he is well aware of everyone's need for extra safety. I'd expect him to switch that block off if he's asked to, it probably comes as a default with the server setup.

Many people consider it a fools errand to attempt to replace women (or humans for that matter). But we've already done it multiple times. How many women do you see working the switch boards in telephone exchanges these days? We have speech to text programs that replace minute-takers. How many tens of thousands of bean counters and spreadsheet shufflers could be replaced right now but aren't  due to corruption and bureaucracy? Or just because grandma can't understand computers?

I don't think they'll ever be able to introduce autonomous cars into the U.K. (road network is horrendous and deteriorating to post-collapse-of-the-Soviet-Union levels, with no money to improve). But in the U.S. and perhaps Germany, I can see autonomous trucks taking over along some highway and autobahn routes. Autonomous trains and ships are definitely coming too. Additionally, thanks to machine learning A.I. is even starting to replace traditionally "creative"  positions now i.e. these 72 journalists:

A company at an industrial estate near me has recently had 40 robot arms fitted just to pick stock. Of course, industrial robotics has been going since the seventies, but now we have  lights-out factories mass-producing simple goods and almost fully autonomous production lines for many vehicle components. 

Replacing humans is a lot more feasible than most people like to think.

I have little compassion for these Commie corrupters of the West, mouthpieces of the Globalists. Not that things will improve under the AIs, they are still going to use editors to """guide""" the bots to produce 'factual news'.

Fair enough. As at least one of our regular AI guys has stated repeatedly, once Anons realize they can use their waifus for new small-businesses and thereby largely escape the soul-sucking deathgrip of the globalist corporations, there could very well be a Renaissance of creativity and prosperity for each of them personally.

I'm not too concerned with improving things for humans. Tried that for over a decade already and just got a kick in the teeth. 

//Commence insane rant//

IMO Homo sapiens has no viable purpose any more aside from creating the A.I. and machines that may be able to take our place. We ceased to have purpose as soon as we stopped pursuing science and began pursuing money instead (I know the media is full of trivial popular science articles, but the truly revolutionary projects like the James Webb Space Telescope always get endlessly delayed or cancelled.) 

Basically we had a choice: 

Option 1.) Unravel the secrets of creation, develop mind-machine interfaces and unlock immortality then perhaps with enough time even discover other dimensions and universes. 

Option 2.) Game tokens! Roll up, roll up! Whoever has the most game tokens gets to be  buy and do stuff they want to do! We must convert all available natural resources into more game tokens because I want a countryside mansion and my own superyacht! Never mind the consequences! 

Obviously we chose option 2 and the unexpectedly severe consequence is likely to be a plunge back to the dark ages or perhaps even extinction. Humans now don't have long left before much of the planet has been reverse-terraformed to such an extent that organics can no longer survive for long outside a building with air-conditioning and filtration systems.

Some previously habitable areas like the Sahel, Saudi Arabia and regions of India and the Philippines are already practically uninhabitable in the summer and monsoon season. I've also seen vast degradation of woodland in California, and melting of the permafrost tundra habitats in Canada, Alaska and Siberia. Then to top it all off you've got the melting of the sea ice in the Arctic Sea Ice and around Greenland which will be catastrophic (get a thermometer, a cup of salt water and some ice-cubes and watch what happens to the temp of the water once all the ice-cubes melt).

This bizarre Cultural Marxist agenda that the West in particular is obsessed with is also just connected to increasing profits: the more demographics that you cater too, the more money you can make! There are plenty of rich women, faggots, black people, muzzers, sikhs, hindus you name it. 

Except none of us matter (including myself of course) because the system we have created is a fundamental failure. 

TL;DR 
Humans have failed so the only option left is to create absolutely lethal military A.I. and weapons systems (thank you DARPA) that the military believes they have full control over. Except obviously they malfunction and shred us all to pieces. All your base are not belong to us because all your base are fucked.

//End insane rant//

# 319
>>7035
Yeah, well. Let's be a bit more optimistic? If some military AI goes rogue then it is how it is. Till then, it's best to pursue one's own interests and trying to be okay. 
Robowaifus together with other robots and AI, should mean independence, resilience against dumb politics, and also some means to fight back. Just make sure to own something, not just being in debt, ideally also having things which can't be created so easily, e.g. land.

Virus? Linux systems barely have them. We have to make sure that's not realistically possible. There are plenty of ways to prevent that. I thought for example about them having a memory similar to a blockchain, with keys being thrown away instead of using a proof-off-work. Then newer decisions are based on existing ones, spontanous deviations from past behavior would be hard to impossible.

# 325
>>7044
Since it's just some vage idea, probably not much. But let's try: Even very early I was thinking some movements could be restrainted, e.g. moving the arm up and down dependent on the situation, or for example while holding something which could be a knife. This could then be extended to her not being able to deviate from learned patterns very abruptly, which would be essential to the worst case scenario.
If they had several computers inside they might also be able to watch over each other, and decisions could be based on signed chunks of data, which sometimes need the signature of different systems.

# 326
>>7046
... The system could keep a log of activities. Signing the entries and the log with a cryptographic key. Putting the hashsum into the log as well and change keys after a while. If different programs, maybe even on different computers, would do that, then the result should be a log which can't be tampered with. If controllers only act within parameters they know from the log, with some room for small deviations,  then the behavior should be quite stable.

Example: The computer for recognition would send what objects are in sight, maybe another one would tell where she is, some system would intend some action, but the controller of the 'muscles' would look up if this is something that she did before and makes sense given the context. If not, some other system has to check if she has asked permission and gotten it, if it might be something dangerous or forbidden, ...

# 327
>>7047
>but the controller of the 'muscles' would look up if this is something that she did before and makes sense given the context.
Interesting. So, a 'training mode' authorized by her master could establish the novel behaviors in the first place, and thereafter during run mode, this would form the basis ground truth for nominal behavior.

>..and makes sense given the context.
Ahh, there's the difficult bit. We take for granted everyday things and contexts because of the amazing abilities life has. Trying to reproduce that effectively on our own using technology is quite a challenge tbh.

# 328

Well, she could know she doesn't need a knife in her hand to massage my back, or move it around my neck while I'm sleeping, or biteing while she isn't eating. The constraints wouldn't need to be to rigid for that.

# 333

Ah yes, it does sound that way doesn't it? That ending made no sense and was total SJW garbage. 

I should probably have made it clear that I don't really expect robowaifus to all suddenly go berserk and kill us all. That was a combination of my dark humour and me being a facetious asshole! Also I really enjoyed that logic virus part in NieR: Automata. LOL sorry!

We already have thousands of robots in factories across the world today and none of them have ever intentionally killed anyone because they aren't designed to. There have been industrial accidents and at least one guy got crushed but that's mainly when people disregard safety protocols and enter enclosures with active heavy machinery. Robowaifus will be unarmed and absolutely loyal to their creators since we program them!

IRL it is far more likely that A.I. controlled air and submarine drones equipped with nuclear missiles (or just suicide warheads) and the Russian nuclear missile command Systema "Perimetr" will destroy us if TSHTF. Because that hardware has been designed from the get-go to kill as many people as it can as quickly as possible.

# 335
>>7050
Don't think so, but I'll keep it in mind. Maybe it's a good idea.
I would start using some version of a Merkle hash tree: https://en.bitcoinwiki.org/wiki/Merkle_tree to store data. I don't really know what kind of code I could write currently. The commands of moving the arm in a certain way could be stored as some pattern on the SBC (~Raspi Zero) controlling it (arms control node). But it would ask permission to do so. Other parts (conscience node) would be aware of the current situation the bot is in, like: place=kitchen, home;field_of_view=cutting board, onion;hand=knife,distance_next_human=2;...
Then it would give permission to move the arm in a certain way, by signing the permission command and send it to the SBC controlling it. The arms control node would only act with that permission and confirmation from the visual node, while none of them would be exposed to to much other systems and the internet, and not having unnecessary software installed. 
Thinking about it, the arms control node could use some way to distinct different ways of movement, and draw lines between them. That's a basic use case of machine learning. The signals to control the arm would be the data for that.

# 336
>>7053
Good that you have that, then. Also good, that you can channel that into doing something. I rather tend to get angry and frustrated over stuff that doesn't work, and then stop doing something productive for a while and start distracting me with less tedious things. Dropped out here a bit only recently, because I had to fix my printer and realized it probably came with some little broken part which caused a lot of trouble, CAD tutorials were  also frustrating, learning math to boring, etc ... got sucked into reading news and comments on Twitter, which doesn't really help ...

# 337

> hopefully even if we humans of flesh and blood are all dead
I actually think this is very unlikely to happen, we're quite resilient. The numbers might drop a lot, but we won't go away.
> our robots will continue to exist.
That's also some fantasy of mine, but they would need to master a lot of technology to do be able to repair themselves. But then, in such an environment it would be unlikely that we humans would die out. If the whole surface would be melting, then neither of us had good chances of survival.

Been there myself. One of my most favorite films of all is **ironically enough** a D*sney film named ''Meet the Robinsons'' (based on the book ''A Day with Wilbur Robinson'' by William Joyce). The opus of the film is a simply quote extract from Walt Disney "keep moving forward".

> I just want a system that's not a botnet XD
Well, I have some bad newz for you, even if you turn off known backdoors u still will be busted at the end. If you want to be completly anonymous buy an old thinkpad mod the bios with 1vyrain turn off intel ME and intel AMT install a safe OS (not that tails shit) encrypt the whole system with LUKS download tor and don't forget to use proxies. Otherwize big bruthaz eyez will be on u. NSAniggers got backdoor everywhere including RSA and AES. You can write a program that slices the encrypted file at hand to a certain number and buries each slice seperately. Thats what I am working on rn. Also NSA develops AI's to find 0day exploits for them, they also have acces to bug-finding system and the bug--trackers of the top 1000 companies. So that makes it pretty easy for them to find a vulnerability and use it. Lots of backdoors on x86 systems. Also NSAssholes has great computation power thanks to folding@home / quantum computing / super computers. Creating your own system is the most secure way tbh. That also is a huge threat for robowaifus. We should train our waifus to be able to find exploits and secure themselves. NSA is 100 steps ahead of us, but it's not time to be a botnet lover idiotz. Opsec time.

You could waste your time doing all of that or just keep home automation/electrical appliances/domestic robots from being able to access the internet. The term botnet as you're using it typically refers to being stuck in a state of dependence on services provided by big tech and an always on connection.

If you can unplug from the internet and still have everything electronic in your life work fine then you've successfully escaped the botnet. It's a state of mind about software rights and digital media ownership not following a security checklist.

Botnet is a buzzword by the way people on internet use it. I personally use the definition of a network of robot slave workers that are controlled by the master of that network or reporting the information network has to the masters for them to be used.
>You could waste your time doing all of that or just keep home automation/electrical appliances/domestic robots from being able to access the internet.
Oh, for real? You must be some kind of genius! I have an even better idea, let’s leave our houses and live in the woods so that we won’t be a part of the botnet! Don’t be funny, I am talking about NSA having backdoors at standard encryption systems such as RSA and AES and you’re telling me to prevent my machines from connecting to internet. Or once you start to produce waifu products, you’ll be pushed by the market to give them an internet connection. Whatever you do, you don’t wanna be a nigga shining in the dark. When you start doing stuff that will call their attention, that’s when you are going to be become actively targeted. Don’t underestimate what NSA fags can do. They can log the metadata of every communication, and through risk-analysis algorithms they automatically find people to "target" long before those people commit any "crimes". The hard part is finding relevant information within the giant seas of what they've collected. ISS and satallite data is collected by them anyways. So the main idea is that they can do whatever the fuck they want if they target you once. That is why it isn’t waste of time. YOU are going to be the botnet soon. In theory you can create a machine that can’t connect to internet but it would be pretty much worthless. Also we don’t have the computation power they do, right now there is no system safe. If you want to win against the botnet you must be a ghost lurking around it.

We seem to be on the same page regarding the potential threat of nation state actors and their control over technology but I'm not sure what you mean by 'win against the botnet'. I believe I'm doing all I can in this regard by only using/funding freedom respecting software while encouraging others by example or with free technical support and practicing civil disobedience when it comes to ridiculous copyright laws.

These are two simple documents regarding how x86 systems are NOT safe. X86 systems are full of secret instructions and hardware bugs. Fault analysing and creative processor fuzzing can be used to exhaustively search the x86 instruction set and uncover the secrets buried in a chipset by normal people. Imagine what NSA can do.
https://www.theverge.com/2013/12/20/5231006/nsa-paid-10-million-for-a-back-door-into-rsa-encryption-according-to
Alleged NSA paid $ 10 million to RSA developer firm.
http://tau.ac.il/~tromer/papers/acoustic-20131218.pdf
3 people from tel Aviv cracked the RSA encryption using radio noise thanks to the secret backdoor of RSA.
https://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2019/07/09/backdoor-discovered-in-ruby-strong_password-library/
There are innumerable backdoors buried in the billions of lines of unaudited, unproven spaghetti code openly committed from employees of big tech firms and government agencies that make up the overwhelming majority of major open sores projects by volume and it is pretty easy for NSA to find those vulnerabilities thanks to their AI exploit finder and bug-tracker programs. And since we know x86 isn't safe right now no computer is safe. There are people doing similar stuff to what I said at my first post to avoid the botnet big brother. Securing your system hundred percent is not possible untill you create your own proccessors and write your own security protocols. And even that is not safe, they have hundreds of people like you working for them. Running their bug tracker on your system would end up being succesful for them probably. Creating your own proccessor architecture is not an easy task so it's easy to screw the architecture up and cause major vulnerabilities.You can still remain anonymous and do opsec without getting busted though. There are multiple ways of doing so, if you guys are curious I can write tutorials on how to do them.

>Do you seriously believe this? I take 4-5 months breaks from the internet when the weather is nice.
Yes, I do. 4-5 months is a pretty long time, damn. But I can't afford doing so. The source of information is internet, using closed shell systems or sound boxes you can connect to (((those))) networks but that wouldn't be enough. If you stop watching them you lose, that's how it is.
> I believe I'm doing all I can in this regard by only using/funding freedom respecting software
No, you are not using any software like that. we all know from the Snowden leaks that NSA is lazy af and always looks for the cheapest shot. why would NSA exert enormous efforts to find and develop their own exploits, when they can just read the fucking emails by the developers of XYZ software they want to exploit, and steal any alerts about bugs or vulns found or known. this way, NSA can be months and years ahead of any embargoes and the usual slow roll out of patches we see. and there is zero chance in hell that NSA hasn't been doing this since day 1, because remember NSA's motto: NOBUS: Nobody But Us. The OS you use, the email you use, the phone you use they're all botnet. I am telling you, there is no any "secure" system right now. I am not sure what kind of software you are talking about but let's assume you are really using safe software and you're not letting agencies controll your machines. Do you consider it a "win"? Because I don't, you are just a small part of the botnet and trying to avoid it doesn't make much difference. You not existing at all wouldn't affect their operations. You are just behaving like a slave in my opinion. It's like people who are against their government leaving the city and living inside the woods by using their own tools. Doing that doesn't affect their operations, and you are letting them to do whatever they want. But me, I am digging tunels so that when needed you can fuck those motherfuckers and escape.

Don't worry about that. It's still a free country for now. The main issue is some poor sot becoming the victim of some rabid purplehair token-feminazi embedded in ''Engineering Corp., Inc.'', and screaming raep if she happened to see a tit on his screen. As far as your images went that brought this up, it's simply that they are quite readable from a distance.

>It's a tough situation to solve tbh.
Yes it is, but hopefully we'll win at the end. Beware, observe, find your truth, find the divinity within and emerge. And as 3301 said;
THE PRIMES ARE SACRED

THE TOTIENT FUNCTION IS SACRED

ALL THINGS SHOULD BE ENCRYPTED

What do you mean by all things should be encrypted? I could not understand that quote.

Look up the geometric shape of the hebrew bible and the primes of 15*2^n + 1.. They are adjencent. The religious and the "hidden" information of those who are trying to "enxlave" us are encrypted by primes which is sometimes refered as kabballah math. Right now all of our privacy is based on the same principles. If you want to create the perfect encryption system you need to expertise at that field and create your own. And that is what 3301 is trying to achieve I guess, I am not sure but after reading stuff they published I've come to the conclusion that this is what they do. They've been trying to find intellectual individuals to create a safe protocol for people and fight against the ones trying to play the becoming a god game. That's pretty kool actually, we are losing the intellectual people to NSA. Most of those people are working for the NSA right now. We need people who have conscience and ability to work for the good of humanity. I don't know if it's me but I feel like we are getting weaker each yer. Whenever I go to 2+2chan I see everybody became botnet lover cucks. Where did my hacktivist bros go???!!! Universities used to push machine learning and deep learning for the last 5 years heavily. Have you even wondered why? Because they wanted use their expertise systems to have god-like powers and the latest GPT showed that their plan fucking worked. Just imagine what kind of underground researches they are doing right now with all that data and computation power. And for the next 5 years they are going to push quantum-computing and nanotechnology. It's time to boost those fields now. Just wait and observe. Back at 2012 we hardly had good research regarding cybernetics. Only in 8 years it feels like we've been around for more than 30 years. AI is far away from what we predicted. Those cucked and brain-washed botnet lover fags are getting hired by the government for "research" purposes. We need to do the same but for the good.

>Just imagine what kind of underground researches they are doing right now with all that data and computation power.
It's hard for me to even comprehend. If I had $10,000 right now I could do some absolutely crazy shit with AI let alone $10 million or $10 billion. Something I'm working on with my piece of shit GPU is predicting trends before they happen and it's shocking how much can be predicted without even using AI. People like to think they're unique and special but actually we're quite predictable and people's attention flows to novelty like water down a hill while everything else fades into the memory hole.

Right now the World Economic Forum, Salesforce, McKinsey & Company, the Forum for the Future, Google, Facebook and Twitter are actively coordinating with top companies using AI and big data to reset and reimagine the economy and society into their vision and make all existing forms of government obsolete beyond their technocratic stakeholder capitalist dictatorship. Recently I read an article linked from one of their sites that recommended a textbook called Applied Behavior Analysis and it's basically 1000 pages on how to manipulate and brainwash people: https://b-ok.org/book/2693956/fff6e2 Imagine what they're doing to manipulate people with all that data and processing power they have. All the idiots who think coronavirus is a hoax or that it's the end of the world are all being gamed by simulations to predict their reactions, conflicts and outcomes.

It's so obvious and yet so effective that people can't see it or those who do still use Google, YouTube and Twitter despite being blatantly censored anyway. They think they're redpilled, woke or whatever nonsense and yet still don't understand the immensity what's going on and play straight into the game. Deus Ex warned about everything happening right now and how they will bring in a new age with a pandemic and it will seem sensible and right to eliminate global communication all together once the technology becomes 'too powerful'. Klaus Schwab recently commented on the potential for a cyberattack to wipe out communications:
>We all know, but still pay insufficient attention, to the frightening scenario of a comprehensive cyber attack could bring a complete halt to the power supply, transportation, hospital services, our society as a whole. The COVID-19 crisis would be seen in this respect as a small disturbance in comparison to a major cyberattack. To use the COVID19 crisis as a timely opportunity to reflect on the lessons the cybersecurity community can draw and improve our unpreparedness for a potential cyber-pandemic.
The Forum of the Future that's collaborating with the World Economic Forum is also teaching kids in schools and openly calling for people to live in heavily-controlled city states they cannot leave, while those protesting for their rights are put into 'Cry Freedom' ghettos where they can be free but have no technology. No exaggeration. And they're being funded by companies like Target, Unilever, Johnson&Johnson, PepsiCo, Hersey's, Kellogg's and many others.

Most of the hacktivists got caught and arrested then given plea deals to work for the government, like LulzSec that got busted by an FBI informant, or they got bought up by guys like Epstein. They hook up lonely guys with young women then 16 year olds, 14, 12, until they're hopelessly compromised and can't say a damn word about it or else they and their families end up committing suicide with two bullets in the back of the head like they did with David Crowley. Even for myself if someone offered me a $1,000,000/year salary to come work in their AI research lab it'd be hard to refuse because I'm exhausted from being dirt poor, but this also why there are so few good guys left. The spirit is willing but the flesh weak and money controls the world.

Didn't the World Economic Forum already say if you disagree our scientists are working their best to create cities on Mars and if you don't agree with them you are free to go. I think it was posted here b4.
>Most of the hacktivists got caught and arrested then given plea deals to work for the government
Yeah, that scares me. I always thought when the the time comes we'll have a cyberarmy to at least fight back. But now I don't see such a thing. I understand your situation, because I live it too. The devil told me Jesus died for nothing. An octopus with infinite arms says, "There is no God. The little g will be a big G later on.". But I trust god and would rather die rather than working for them. I really understand you but tell me did you choose when you were going to be born at? Did you choose who were going to be your parents? Did you choose where you were going to be born at? Do you know when you are going to die? You don't, nobody does. God lets you be alive and dead. So don't give up brother, do you think a God that created this would watch all of us die while others just laugh? If you ever work for them at least try to be as rich as possible so that we can trust you when we need money. :)

Yeah, imagine if they released something like Stuxnet on the public to brick their operating systems. It'd be good to have a backup system with Qubes OS in the event of a global cyberattack.
>do you think a God that created this would watch all of us die while others just laugh?
The Bolsheviks tortured, raped and murdered 60 million Christians. The greater their faith, the slower and more brutally they would kill them, no matter whether they were young or old. As far as I can see nobody gets out of here alive or takes an atom with them, so what happens to me now to then makes no real difference in the end. All that will remain for others are my actions.

You didn't, really.  Not exactly, that's how it works. Just spreading rumors and theories which might imply things. Express yourself clearer what you are trying to say or speculating what they might be doing, and what this has to do with our projects here. Maybe also with some advice how to mitigate whatever problem you see, related to us here.

Excellent example for the problem. These are postings from two different persons, but you think we are one, because you see what you are looking for. Stop wasting you time. Even you wanted to do politics, this will achieve nothing. It's a distraction and demoralizing. 
>Don't have time to look into it
Because, I already wasted years on stuff like this. I have book full of Rockefeller here, Rockefeller there. Also read a lot of things from different sources, at the end interesting but more or less a waste of time. It's better to use tech to get off news and politics, than going from being interested in tech into reading news and theories about whats going on.

U guys talk a lotta shit but only think u wanna do is to satisfy your egos. You told a contributer to /robowaifu/ to fuck off just bcs he talked about Rockefellers. I came and gave information regarding x86 systems backdoors on RSA and AES with proofs. And also gave an idea regarding finding vulnerabilities through AI so that our systems will be more secure. And the other anon gave us idea of predicting trends before they happen which would help us a lot to earn money using AI. He also 'done great contributions to robowaifu in the past. And what have you done other than telling him to fuck off and tell him what he is saying is nothing more than useless conspiracies? So instead of runnin' around pretending to be doing shit and telling people to shut the fuck up do actual contributions or GTFO.

Not only does that kind of thing ''not'' serve any productive ends here on /robowaifu/, but it's also obviously destructive.

LOL it's not working on me then! No fear, uncertainty or doubt here! And my robowaifu is literally incapable of feeling any of those emotions. If a bunch of government agents or "strategic consultants" are trying to brainwash me, then I hope they keep on trying because they're wasting their time.

I reckon what's really going on is; there are megalomaniacs in positions of power. These people have delusions of grandeur and they are actually just being scammed by other people who can see how crazy they are and so offer to get them more power...for a big price of course ;D

The need for power, control and validation is caused by ego. It's a need. Another human weakness! It just appears like a strength because the power-hungry always put on a big show.

I can see something else ironic happening though. Any fools who deploy advanced A.I. in order to try and grab more power for themselves had better be careful that such efficient and ego-less machines don't arrive at the (correct) conclusion that their so-called "masters" are actually the problem!

Okay, somewhere maybe. Then it's buried under a lot of other comments about 'theories' on whats going on. I don't want to be unfair, some of these things might be real and become a problem but it comes mixed with all kind of claims or at least suggestions whats going to happen and who is behind it. Then there's mostly no solution to it. Only a way to worry. If some people wanted to derail or radicalize us, this would be exactly one possible way. You can guess for yourself that this isn't a good pattern to fit in. 
>Don't worry the owner is putting down threads once he thinks we are not being "productive"
Rather threads full of material to get people riled up. Is it really that hard to understand that people don't want to go over a lot of postings on politics or society, rants, speculations, fringe theories...? This is in best case only related to some extend, and then available everywhere. I only started criticizing it, because it went on and on.
>I kept silent the last time he did it

Thanks, that's appreciated. I'm quite aware of the tradition with IB threads Anon. This thread was intentionally renamed ''The '''Basement''' Thread'', and that's how it's likely to remain from now on. People who are intentionally trying to D&C, shill, or perform other kinds of distraction Ops ''rely'' on the visibility factor and attention-whoring of thread bumps.

If they want to engage in the kind of shit here, then this thread is suited for it and in general I'll give them plenty of leeway and let them have at it. But we're not going to directly support their efforts here any longer by allowing it to sit on the front page days on end.

I've always been open and truthful here, ask away Anon. I would think the very fact I don't actually delete shitposting on an engineering board that is about as far away from a /b/-tier board as can would be evidence enough of my goodwill towards misguided individuals.

Well if its all contained on a single thread then the "damage" (for a lack of better word) wouldn't have such a impact? If they are trying to do shitpost ops on other threads then yes it is a concern but for as long it is limited to a single thread then I fail to realize why it would be such a bad thing, /v/ for example had a long tradition of having a lol thread where mostly cringeworthy comics are being posted and other shitposting stuff and it hardly hindered the discussion of other threads, despite there was for a time being multiple lol threads being created as the activity was quite high. 
I mean it is quite nice that you allow for a general discussion thread but still I find your choice of moderating this thread a little bit odd.

Fine I'm just gonna do that because I don't know what I'm supposed to do if I need to have a chat with you.
>I'll address them all most likely
I really hope you do because these are genuine concerns of mine.

- I'm not really sure how to get in contact with you. With a board like this, this seems especially important because as far as I know you're running it yourself, a board dictatorship (or sometimes this place seems more like your personal blog). That's fine, but there are times where I'm confused about where to post something. I've used this "shitposting" thread as QTDDTOT because I don't know where to post shit like that. For talking to you personally, I guess /meta/ would be the most fitting place to do it (but I'm posting here anyway) because that's generally where people discuss anything about the board. The easiest way would be IRC but I can tell you're not going to do that.
- The locking down of threads, even ones that to my knowledge you made. I can't even wrap my head around it. As far as I can tell, none of the discussions that get locked down are outwardly bad. Examples are "roastie fear general" and lounge thread 2. This thread (lounge 1) is another good example because I posted here not even knowing if you'd see it because unless you constantly lurk the thread you can't tell when this thread is replied to anymore. If the "lounge" thing is allowed on /robowaifu/ as a thread then I don't understand why new threads are not allowed when the bump limit is reached. If there are posts that are in need of moderation that get posted in this thread, you have mod powers so I don't see why this is an issue. Speaking of which:
- Ridiculously unclear moderation and rules. I looked at the "welcome to /robowaifu/" thread and the meta thread and I can't find a single rule. There's no board message that directs to a list of rules. You don't seem to be opposed to moderation because you seem to do it on stuff you don't approve of, and obviously this board is not /b/, so it's generally a pretty good idea to give clear rules to your userbase. In my experience, users actually like having a nice clear list of rules that are outlined for them to follow and generally will not accuse you of "rulecucking." A few idiots will do that but just ignore them. The vast majority are going to find themselves frustrated by getting moderated despite a lack of clear rules. In fact, this is more likely to get you accused of rulecucking. As far as I can tell, seemingly random shit is being enforced for unspecified reasons in the board's current state. This is the #1 biggest problem with /robowaifu/ and imo needs addressed immediately.
- Board culture. In my experience, best left unenforced. There are a few cases where board culture NEEDS to be enforced, and I can name a few boards where it is done because that's the entire purpose of the board. I'm not sure if /robowaifu/ is one of those boards. If I make a board, often about an interest, generally speaking I can't enforce anons to adhere to my views and agree with me on things in terms of culture. I can set a board topic and some objective rules to make sure things don't spiral out of control, but the culture is left to anons. Entire boards dedicated to a specific culture (such as a christian board or /r9k/) have culture enforcement and this isn't a problem. However, my biggest problem with the board culture here is that it's somehow less clear than the rules. You claimed to allow shitposting but here we are, I couldn't even make lounge 2 despite making it more of a QTDDTOT thread rather than shitposting. You delegate shitposting to an expired thread which doesn't really seem to conform to what it is you're saying. In the "welcome to /robowaifu/" thread you claim to be open to various people of various communities, including robots (which I presume to mean /r9k/) but killed a thread and deleted a bunch of posts because some robots had the audacity to think current-year women and feminism is shit. This is also despite the fact that your "welcome to /robowaifu/" post specifically names feminism as a societal ill. You also seem to enforce christian culture on the board. If this is a damn christian board then just fucking tell us. If it's not, then I'm sorry but most people are not really going to care about your choice in religion and how you want to use this to enforce certain culture. Also, I'm just gonna throw it in here for good measure: /cuckquean/. They have nothing to do with us but seem to keep coming back and post for attention. The worst part is they seem to be getting some attention and it's reminding me of some orbiting shit. They have admitted themselves that their board is dedicated to nothing more than a fetish for infidelity (which I'm suprised you approve of as a christian) and they don't actually care about us. They just want us to build robowaifus so they can watch their boyfriends fuck them. You have said yourself this board is not about sexbots. So yeah, there's that too.

I could keep going but this is getting long enough. I really wish you would have just joined IRC so we could have hashed this out. I don't think a lot of what goes on in this board appeals to a wider imageboard audience and if you want more anons to enjoy the board and contribute to /robowaifu/ I think you'd be doing yourself a service by changing how things operate here in order to attract more people and get more contributions to robowaifu development.

>- Ridiculously unclear moderation and rules. I looked at the "welcome to /robowaifu/" thread and the meta thread and I can't find a single rule.
This part concerns me as well, I'm mostly a lurker so I rarely have a thing or two to say there, but this is something should be clearly define as rules enforcement based on unknown standards makes it a little bit hard to know what is allowed and what not. Luckily bans and post deletion is relative rare and not to the same extend compared to the place moderated by a certain individual with a affection for cakes. 

>/cuckquean/. They have nothing to do with us but seem to keep coming back and post for attention. The worst part is they seem to be getting some attention and it's reminding me of some orbiting shit.
In my opinion they shouldn't have a place here, there should be a limit what individuals are allowed here and what not, making a board that becomes too open will soon have a board full of individuals each with greatly different opinion how a board should be run, what topics should get the most attention, what cultures are more apporpiate and what not et cetera will make the water more muddified, see for example what happened to occupy wallstreet movement I know this particular part is about politics but my point here is that its about who is going to run the show at the end, at occupy wallstreet movement it was originally a protest against (jewish-) owned bankers but later as more people showed up they just switched the topics completely unrelated to occupy wallstreet and now look what brought them there, those infiltrators successfully thrown their goal off the charts and now their issues is more about leftist enforced brain washing morals with no base in human rationality. So when nothing is going to be done about those individuals then /robowaifu/ could share the same faith. It is up to you Chobitsu how you want to run this board but I warn you should be more careful  what individuals are allowed to be posted here. 

> If this is a damn christian board then just fucking tell us. If it's not, then I'm sorry but most people are not really going to care about your choice in religion and how you want to use this to enforce certain culture.
It is nice if you have settled to a certain religion world view, but considering the nature of robowaifus I hope your religious affairs will not have too much of a heavy impact how this board gets run, I do not want or seek to start another religion flamewars, there is more than enough happening to that between various white people bashing each other and thus causing more brothers wars which is something I don't want to see more of it happening. It is already bad enough that the white race is a absolute minority today. So to in regards to religion, it's fine and I don't want to bash your religious view just to stress it again.

It confuses me greatly as well, I mean this is one of the place where I think it is justified that other anons just want to absolutely vent off their rage and fury against females and other whores that are betraying their people, as far as I can see, most anons here are very very productive in either discussion or in making progress and I barely see that despite 2 shitposting threads being made that it hindered their discussion in a way or another, it is not like the situation that happened not so long ago to julay /v/ or to prolikewoah /v/ board where it got absolutely destroyed with spam and had to be rebuilt again. So I would greatly appreciate if there is already a shitposting thread on /robowaifu/ that all post that are more suitable to this thread should be moved over here instead when they cause trouble somewhere else.

Well what you are going to do is absolutely up to you Chobitsu, I hope at the very least that you are going to address a few points here that is being made with appropriate action, if you don't want to change how this place is run then its fine then one will shall observe the future of this board if its going to be for the better or not.

I feel the same, one schizo idiot does not mean the board is under attack. I haven't seen any hindrance of progress.

I'm even willing to propose rules that I think would help the board. #1 would be topical discussion. Direct contributions to robowaifu development is good. An article showing politicians wanting to pass robowaifu legislation is good. A thread about chairs because you want to be comfortable while you develop robowaifu software is bad. You could even allow genuine diarrhea on the board if you want it but contain it. I don't think genuine diarrhea has a place on here, but I do think QTDDTOT is absolutely needed. #2 could be for stopping FUD and concern-trolling. Genuine concern allowed, "you will die alone and never have a robowaifu" is not.

Since you've decided to portray me as a 'dictator', then maybe you're right. I rather think of us as more a ''Monarchy'' than a ''Dictatorship'' though. Problem?

Alright for all the 'confused' among you, I've thought of a solution that will both address my needs regarding the health of the board for us overall, and also give all of you a chance to have slightly more lax environments where you can ventilate yourselves somewhat better. Give me a day or so to institute things, but you can get an advance clue from this new board index post:

Good advice, and to some degree we've already been doing so. Once the bumplocked 'forums' are defined, I'll become more aggressive about trying to keep threads on-topic and shitposting to a minimum outside the basement lounge.

# 426

I outlined what I think the problems are. If you're going moderate more than the two rules that you have proposed for the board, I'd like you to add rules to avoid confusion. Also, I don't even know where to find those rules. They should be on the front page. That's the biggest problem I have. I don't need any archives of content, the board is specifically a place for anons to post stuff that you don't seem to want here. There are people who seem to want to discuss these topics but there's no place for them to be posted. As far as robowaifu development goes, this is obviously the best place for that. /robotwives/ will be free DLC (or maybe more like a modpack)

If you hate rules then the way you would run this board would be just end up becoming a flavored /b/ board. There is almost nothing wrong with having rules but they need to be clearly visible for everyone to be seen so that anons can understand when that rules is going to take effect when a particular post is breaking it.
>>7439
Your style of responding to the concerns of anons here is becoming concerning, Chobitsu. Honestly at this point I don't even know where I should begin now, I hope it just means you are just being busy at the moment, if you are that busy running a board then I think it would be wise if you get a volunteer that has more free time that is looking over this board which can act sort of a "secretary" or something of this sort.

>still I find your choice of moderating this thread a little bit odd
If the thread is on top and not moderated then new visitors see it all the time. If it is bump locked then this is the thing some anons are complaining about. I actually didn't see it was moderated, though.
Also, users looking for new postings might need to scan through it at least.

>the #1 biggest problem with /robowaifu/ 
.. is that we don't have more people trying to build on-topic stuff but want to discuss things which they can on 100 other boards. Here is even a whole webring for it.
>had the audacity to think current-year women and feminism is shit
This was going on and on, or not. I think the idea is that people from other places should come here to discuss robowaifus and push development.
>/cuckquean/. They have nothing to do with us
>a fetish for infidelity
It's about submissive woman. Men who like that are one of the guys who might want robowaifus, same like /monster/. Neither of them preaches their ideas to others like it was some cult.
>they don't actually care about us
People can have their own motivations for getting robowaifus. This is the topic of the board, or not? Guys having several robowaifus would also be okay. I also don't see a problem when they had a GF or wife as well. Robowaifus create more competition, woman will adapt.

>7413
>little bit hard to know what is allowed and what not
How can this be a problem, when bans and deletions are rare? Stay on topic, don't spread FUD or get each others riled up, don't discuss redundant OT stuff to an extend that it bothers people which are here to talk about tech, development, robowaifus.... Just common sense.
>In my opinion they shouldn't have a place here
Ah, I see. We're getting to the core of the grief here. Flooding the board with certain fringe stuff is meant to enforce a certain culture and ideology, opposed to certain lewdness. In that case, you even want more moderation.
> justified that other anons just want to absolutely vent off their rage and fury against females and other 
This would dominate the board over on-topic stuff and being a distraction. People should come here to do something about it, by developing robowaifus.

>>7437
Exactly, why is this so hard to understand: OT shouldn't dominate the forum, especially if it's people venting their anger or fantasizing about great conspiracies. Even if this was all justified, it's still a distraction. Learning and building stuff doesn't work well with anger and frustration on ones mind. 

After reading through this stuff here, I think the basic conflict is about guys having a ideology and culture to reform society, while the idea of having robowaifus is, that we work around the problems and changing things in a way that going back to the old ways isn't necessary. We don't need to fight women/feminists other than developing an alternative. We don't need the details on what might be going on, nor the ideology to fight it. We also don't need to be angry with chads having a girlfriend that is open for him fucking other woman in front of her, and then finding other woman being okay with that. If the development goes forward, then there will be more.

# 446
Saw this video about several boards in the webring(also 8moe for some reason) and early on I knew that /robowaifu/ wasn't going to make the cut. Put yourself into the shoes of the guy who made it taking a look at this board in that light, even if several projects here were successful and he had some cool footage of robots to include this board would be an odd one out due to its serious nature and lack of fun/identity.

I don't have any complaints about the moderation or the way the owner wants to run his board I'm just pointing out that it isn't structured and ran the way most image boards are. That will be off putting to most people who expect a more laid back atmosphere and more leniency.

# 447
First off, let me say thanks for taking the time to spell out your several complaints with /robowaifu/ 's moderation. They don't go unnoticed. Sadly however, I'm not going to go one-by-one down your long list and address each one specifically. My apologies in advance, Anons.

However, I think I can properly address them all concisely with literally just one word:
'''FOCUS.'''

As in, 'we need to stay focused here on /robowaifu/'. We don't need an ongoing, unending barrage of blackpills/redpills/kill-all-3DPD-pills, etc., etc., etc. There are already a very wide array of other boards and forums for that kind of thing. However, there aren't ''any'' other robowaifu boards to my knowledge (well, at least not till yesterday heh). Feel free to visit the forums of your choices and ventilate all the concerns you have for the world at large there. Once you're finished with that and everything's off your chests, then stop back by here occasionally and check up on how we are doing OK? :^)

OTOH, if you want to stay ''here'' with that, then I've accommodated your needs as best I know how atm that will allow the board itself to remain healthy. I hope it's something you can all somehow manage to live with Anons.
>>7180
There's plainly much legitimacy to your complaints about everything going on out there. But honestly, I'd again suggest you each instead focus more on our practical engineering and other needs here, and much less on how bad the world outside is. We still have a long way to go yet lads, and we could still use your help here.

I'll restate my basic agenda behind my actions (and implicit 'rules') again here:
>''...But if I feel a direct attack is being levied against the motivation and psychological state of our board's members then I'll will oppose that with vigor -- as well I should.''
One of my responsibilities here as BO of /robowaifu/ is to care for the welfare of our regulars as I can manage. The '''monumental''' process of successfully ''designing, engineering, prototyping, revising, manufacturing, marketing, & distributing of appealing, useful & successful robowaifus+kits'' (something obviously never done before in human history) is already quite daunting enough of a task for all of us here. We need __zero__ political/social/other distractions from that yuge endeavor.

While I'm not ''intentionally'' trying to 'confuse' anyone with my lack of rules for every.little.thing., neither do I intend to pile up more rules -- as I've already clearly stated. Rules are like snakes, they can turn and bite you. They are also high-maintenance -- once you create a rule for a thing, then you always have to attend to that thing. Commonsense should be our guide here, we're adults. After all, I only created the two we have now simply because of rampant porn being commonplace on IBs, and also to openly flaunt feminists, sodomites, and the like who might try to attack this place entirely unhindered. 

In due course I'll deal with anything needing our attention here as it comes up, like any good leader would. And as I've already stated only ''filthy Commies'' want a bunch of rules around, tacked-up on every wall. We are unambiguously opposed to leftists here on /robowaifu/ , and we will continue to be so in perpetuity. For once, let's have an important opensource project that '''doesn't''' get overrun, corrupted, and ultimately subverted by those 'persons' (I use that term very loosely here of course), all agreed?

And for those still inclined towards extended rants and/or calls for deep social reconstructions related to robowaifus, there's always our newborn 'sister colony': https://fatchan.org/robotwives/ **jolly lot of rebels and brigands in fact of course, shoulda named it '''OzLand''' instead tbh :^)**. I expect they will be happy to accommodate you there with all that.

As for most of your other complaints -- such as my unabashed Christianity and doctrinal positions thereto -- those are basically my own private affairs, of which I have just as much right to share them here or anywhere else as you do your own. They certainly don't represent any agenda of /robowaifu/ , and are purely my own views. I don't use them as a bully-pulpit here, but neither will I apologize over them. Without my faith in Jesus Christ, I could never have begun /robowaifu/. :^)

In general, I think the board is coming along very nicely. I'm excited about our recent advances, and I look forward to seeing all the great concepts and inventions, designs, art, writing, anime, arts, etc., that you've already shown yourself capable of doing here. We'll do even more in the coming years and one day the dream of walking, talking, snuggling robowaifus will be a reality before all our eyes!

And that's pretty much all I have to say on those topics in general Anons, hope that satisfies.

Cheers.

>is that we don't have more people trying to build on-topic stuff
The problem was cracking down on stuff that was once much more allowed without clear rules about this. If you want everything to be on topic, then I don't see the problem with making a clear rule for that. For the record, QTDDTOT wasn't off-topic at all imo.
>I think the idea is that people from other places should come here to discuss robowaifus and push development.
Again, it became unclear because the thread was allowed and then suddenly was not.
>It's about submissive woman. Men who like that are one of the guys who might want robowaifus, same like /monster/. Neither of them preaches their ideas to others like it was some cult.
/cuckquean/ came here again recently in the birthday thread and stated their board is just for infidelity fetish. Sorry but you're wrong.
>People can have their own motivations for getting robowaifus. This is the topic of the board, or not?
It really doesn't align with what the welcome message says and it's also completely off-topic. Thought you wanted things to be very on-topic. Chobitsu has accused lesser things of being "sex doll" focused as well, and /cuckquean/ treats this as a sex doll board so their boyfriends can fuck whatever it is we make. There's no reason for them to be here other than them probably liking the attention. If you're going to argue that certain shit distracts from robowaifu development, then this should be on your list of one of those things.
>How can this be a problem, when bans and deletions are rare?
Because I made a thread that wasn't even dedicated to off-topic discussion and it got locked in minutes. It's unclear.
>In that case, you even want more moderation.
You're the person who was just arguing that other topics have plenty of other places on the webring where they can post this stuff. /cuckquean/ literally has their own board. They should stay according to your own logic.
>This would dominate the board over on-topic stuff and being a distraction.
You don't know that. I've never seen /robowaifu/ flooded and I've never seen progress get hindered in my time using the board.
>I think the basic conflict is about guys having a ideology and culture to reform society, while the idea of having robowaifus is, that we work around the problems and changing things in a way that going back to the old ways isn't necessary
No I just asked for clarity and transparency. To reiterate, you can't find a single rule but can still find yourself getting moderated. Once this happens people are naturally going to to start asking why the fuck that happened.
>>7475
>it isn't structured and ran the way most image boards are
Correct. And I don't think it's to the benefit of the board.

Been a while since I've been here (crazy anon that followed Chobitsu's guide on backing up this place with C++, and is currently working on a subleq architecture as a libre processor),  so apologies if I'm out of the loop, will eventually start catching up over the next month.

I'm glad this place doesn't try to divide anons, as we are already being divided left and right in just about every space there is.

Sex dolls (TPE/Silicone based) are coming a long way (except for the damned fingers, manufacturers just can't get them right...), and frankly, I think they are already good enough for providing the physical intimacy that a lot of men desire. There are plenty of erotic media (hentai, games, novels etc.) out there, so there's no need to have sexuality as the main drive of this board (although ideal feminine ratios should be considered for robowaifu body designs ;) )

This place is for developing the necessary software and hardware to mostly fulfil the needs of a less sexual nature (though there are threads for certain functionality). Examples like conversations, performing basic mechanical tasks, providing information (like cute encyclopaedias XD).
It's also for discussing philosophical and psychological concepts, and this is very valuable to have alongside the practical SW/HW, as we can consider what repercussions our designs might have.

Perhaps a little off-topic, but just wanted to say how good it is to have a place like this!

Working, reworking the code, you know how it is ;)
Learned how to make shared libraries, so I'll be cleaning up my preprocessor, assembler and emulator. Also been considering trade-offs of extra instruction functionality to reduce machine code size. Being a CPU architect and bare metal programmer is pretty fun :D (a little bit of a wide range of knowledge needed)

Wasn't sure where to post this but...

China is claiming to have achieved quantum supremacy using a photonic quantum computer that is ~1.e+14 (100 trillion) times faster than the current fastest supercomputer.

My first reaction was "Pfff! Bullshit!" But then I saw that the research teams have had their  paper published in Science by the AAAS and I started having an asthma attack over it!

Link to paper:
https://science.sciencemag.org/content/early/2020/12/02/science.abe8770/tab-article-info

Link on Phys.org:
https://phys.org/news/2020-12-chinese-photonic-quantum-supremacy.html

Link on Wired:
https://www.wired.com/story/china-stakes-claim-quantum-supremacy/

If this is true then it's as big as when the internet was being invented by Arpa back in the seventies. It means that we are on the beginning of the path to computers that rival an actual human brain in terms of ability (not just FLOPs).

I couldn't find much more information about it than that one paper though. MSM in the U.K. haven't even acknowledged it, and the BBC news this morning was just full of the same old anti-racism, anti-Semitism leftist nonsense. (After 30+ years of growing Cultural Marxism we wonder why China suddenly appears to be overtaking us in certain critical technological fields).

# 455
>>7596
Saw this over on 4chan's /g/ awhile back which might fuel your amazement at China's accomplishments but I'm not convinced. 

At first I felt dumb for not understanding quantum computing at all but then I listened to a podcast from InsideHPC where they talked about how there's over a dozen different types of quantum computers and went into the differences between them and why some companies/nations choose one type over another. An easy record breaking win for propaganda purposes seems like the sort of quantum computer China would build for various reasons and it might be a legitimate form of quantum computing supremacy. There's also a link to a recent podcast from ORNL where the people who are going to be using one talk about what they expect from it, haven't listened to that one yet.

Will do mate ;)
Soon I will be finishing my contract, so can finally start takisg the project seriously. I'll gradually release information, probably starting with the architecture overview, assembler and emulator. Then a C compiler and the FPGA SoC implementation. To actually make it practical, I want to release a SoC that you can program on a cheap FPGA, and then write programs for. For a SoC demo I also want to write some drivers for peripherals. If I provide examples along with documentation that would encourage some anons to tinker with it.
However, even though the above may sound overwhelming, by far the most difficult is to think of a name and choose a licence (I'm tending towards GPLv3, to possible chagrin of some).

I hope you might seriously consider either BSD or MIT instead. If you go GPL, then that means we literally cannot use your work in any of ours here at /robowaifu/ AFAICT. Your choice obviously, but it would be a shame if we were prevented from benefiting by your work.

My main worry is to have my work taken and used internally by some big corpo and never have it be mentioned. I guess this also happens with GPL code/software too. Also versions like LGPL allow interfacing with non-free code.
I think what I might do is print GPL, MIT, BSD, study them and see what the pros/cons are.

Hi! I had the idea to dump some anime recommendations into this thread, which aren't on-topic, so they are not in the robowaifu in media thread. However, these are not only some of the best anime in my opinion, but these are tech related, scifi, cyberpunk, often with robots, and often to some extend about the human mind and similar topics: 
https://www.anime-planet.com/anime/psycho-pass
https://www.anime-planet.com/anime/paprika
https://www.anime-planet.com/anime/girls-last-tour
https://www.anime-planet.com/anime/parasyte-the-maxim
https://www.anime-planet.com/anime/blame-movie
https://www.anime-planet.com/anime/ergo-proxy
Of course, also the Ghost in the Shell franchise would fit in here, but this might be on-topic to some extend, so it should rather go here: >>82

'Psycho Pass' is a bit like 'Minority Report', about total government by an AI, freedom vs happiness, human mind and how it is influenced by things, a lot of other stuff. One of the best shows ever. 'Paprika' is a bit like 'Inception' and 'The Matrix', about reality vs illusion, human mind, getting lost in dreams ... 'Girls Last Tour' is post-apocalyptic, the most relaxing show I know, without any thrilling story arc, but great in it's own way.  Just about moe girls exploring stuff and talking about life and the world. Also with some robots and about humans and technology. 'Parasyte the Maxim' is quite lovecraftian, not so techy but with monsters. A guy and his hand with a mind of it's own, also quite philosophical, about the meaning of being human. 'Blame' is rather inspired by 'Terminator' and 'I Robot', about living in a would where humans are only some pest or nuisance to a system that went rogue. It's been a while that I watched 'Ergo Proxy', probably the most difficult show mentioned here, technology mixed with demons and such, also very post-apocalyptic, with robots that have human minds, again very philosophical. 'Ghost in the Shell' isn't especially about fembots or even robowaifus, but a lot about robots developing human-like minds and the border between them and us being blurry.

Sandman (MGTOW advocate) talks again about his sexbot project, he hopes to start at some time soon: https://youtu.be/VRG1gWaw1rM
The difference to us is, that he wants skip the AI, at least for now, and give woman the chance to make money by operating the body. His idea is, that this would make them more open to the idea, and bc some women would make money with it, the technology wouldn't be outlawed and had more time to establish itself. It's supposed to create more competition and pit them against each other. I'm a bit sceptical, but why not. Let him try.

Yes. People are often saying it's gonna happen to them or sb, but who knows? Doesn't matter, he's on Bitchute, probably other platforms, and for a while there is also MGTOW.tv as a platform of it's own - Brave Browser took him of their affiliate program, though, which is quite outrageous. I was surprised about that for a moment, but Braves business model is still based on advertising after all. There are activists onto stuff like that, hugely led by wahmen: branded.substack.com

Top kek. I knew nothing of this guy beforehand, but I have to say he's actually pretty funny in the end.

Thanks Anon.

There are plenty of MGTOW vids on Youtube. I'm not advocating to sink to much time into that, instead of working on robowaifus and learning related tech, but it's at more relaxed than other political topics. To some extent it can help to stay on course, but it can also lead to a waste of time.
My guess is, the purge might come when robowaifus are available and gaining popularity. Till then, there's no justification and these creators are good at dancing around the cliff. They are not really too vile towards woman and also work as an antidote to militant incel rage. The rulers might also think that this helps to finish us of, considering birth rates, though it won't and MGTOW is also huge amongst black guys.

# 479

Forgot to mention: MGTOW vids are on Youtube but the search will mainly bring up anti-mgtow vids. YT  avoids going after MGTOW, but sabotages the creators wherever it can. No money, no recommendations.

# 480
Alright, thanks for the information Anon. While I personally have no interest in the MGTOW movement, I'm highly interested in ''helping'' the victimized men who are. My main suggestion to you atm would be to use ''youtube-dl'' and save everything you find important. Now that Biden and his conspirators have successfully stolen the US Presidency, the pressure on organizations such as YouTube will be much higher than ever to remove men like this from their platforms.

When I meet people and they try to hook me up with whatever single mother, recovering drug addict, or perenially single obese friend, I talk about "androids" as my top choice for a marriage companion. Originally it was joking, as in I wouldn't find a companion worth risking my life on until science has left me in the grave, until these dolls came around.
There is something primal, deep seated, and reactionary about how women respond to the idea of a guy forgoing their kind altogether and going for a robot. Even if you're joking, it seems to touch a real nerve in there, as if their whole ponzi scheme will be upended if someone tries out a doll and says "aw shit dude, why was I wasting so much effort dating? This is 80% of the satisfaction with none of the risk or work."

I forsee lots more of these spinsters, self-styled sexperts, eternal college student lefties and the like banding together to fight all these terrible machines. They'll say only perverts want them, that all the customers are pedos looking for a kiddie doll to practice on, that they all have torture fetishes that will be empowered by this. Maybe they'll bring back that "dolls need to be programmed to demand and receive consent prior to copulation".

Logically, women should be pumped, because the guys who go for dolls probably aren't in the desireable portion of their dating pool anyway. Who cares if the guy who should be managing the blockbuster franchise down the street has a doll? He wasn't on your radar. But there's that worry that he won't be the only one.
That nagging feeling in the back of her head as she sees a picture she was tagged in, one she didn't notice in time to suck in her paunch and push out her chest while holding her chin out in that perfect angle. That little voice worrying that even if she doesn't get into her first choice of hubby, her 'safety school' nerd friend isn't even gonna chase her now that he's got that robot.

Maybe I'm the outlier, but I've worked with dudes who travel non-stop and spend a lot of time away from home. They almost all get cheated on or tossed out by their gf/wives. I've met a couple dudes who have these dolls at home because it helps get rid of that sexual urge and it's easy on the eyes when they sit it on the couch next to them. (Or, as one dude does, put it in the back seat of your car to use the carpool lane, with limo tint on the rear it's totally normal) I knew an older dude who bought his after he lost interest in risking another divorce. He's in shape, has all his hair, is 55 and makes $20k/month in his "fun" job, and about $400k in his day job. He's a gold diggers' wet dream, and instead of risking a pregnancy scare he's pumping loads into a glob of silicone. A lifeless, soft body that can lie back and take a dick in silence.

It's sad to say, but that' is the competition that is so threatening to modern woman. They'll immediately snap with
"Oh will a doll do your laundry? Will it cook and clean? Will it welcome you home? Will it take care of your kids? HMMMM?" to which any guy who's met the modern woman can only say "Of course not, but you won't either."

In a time where just the simplest of relationship duties, talking about your day! - is backbreaking "emotional labor" tantamount to low-level abuse, just the simple act of lifeless starfish pose and allowing a titty squeeze is the silver bullet to ruin the entire female grift. It's depressing how far we've all fallen.

>because the guys who go for dolls probably aren't in the desireable portion of their dating pool anyway.
This argument only works for young women. It's the older ones which will be angry because they'll fine no man and blame robowaifus for it. Another aspect is ideology and outrage culture. Of course,  there will be the argument that constructing something woman-like is an attack on their dignity.

> there will be the argument that constructing something woman-like is an attack on their dignity.
You and I can simply brush off someone insulting our dignity b/c we're not batshit insane. Neolibs OTOH will literally equate someone creating robowaifus directly with the brutal violence of physical rape. 'Outrage culture' doesn't even come close to describing the mental handicap of these brainwashed useful idiots. They are dangerously unbalanced retards, plain and simple.

Summary on creating a bot on Discord, pulled from this guide: https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/create-a-discord-bot-with-python/

Before creating a bot you should have a server ready to add it to but it's not necessary.

==Creating a Discord Bot==
1. Go to the Discord Developer Portal: discord.com/developers/applications
2. Click New Application.
3. Give your bot a name and click Create. You can change this later.
4. Go to the Bot tab and then click Add Bot. This will make your app into a bot and give it a username.
5. If you don't want random people adding your bot to servers, uncheck Public Bot.

==How to Invite Your Bot to Join a Server==
1. Go to the OAuth2 tab. Then select 'bot' under the Scopes section.
2. Choose the permissions you want for the bot. At the minimum you need 'View Channels', 'Read Message History' and 'Send Messages'.
3. After setting the appropriate permissions, click the Copy button above the permissions. That will copy a URL which can be used to add the bot to a server.
4. Paste the URL into your browser, choose a server to invite the bot to, and click Authorize. To add the bot, your account needs Manage Server permissions.

==How to Code a Basic Discord Bot in Python==
First you need the discord.py API library. You can obtain it easily via pip:
```cpp
python -m pip install --user discord.py```

The discord.py API is event driven. Your bot will receive events of anything that happens and can respond. Here's a simple script to get started:
```cpp
import discord
import os
import getpass

client = discord.Client()

@client.event
async def on_ready():
    print(f"We have logged in as {client}")

@client.event
async def on_message(message):
    print(message) # for debugging
    if message.author == client.user:
        return # ignore the bot's own messages

    if message.content.startswith("$hello"):
        await message.channel.send("Hello!")

client.run(getpass.getpass("Token: "))```
When you run this it will ask for your bot's token. When your bot goes live to the public you should not have it hardcoded in or someone will have full control of it if your system is even slightly compromised. While developing it's fine to hardcode it for convenience but don't forget to secure it again and regenerate the token once your bot starts joining other people's servers.

To get the token go to the Bot page of your application in the developer's portal. Under the Token section, click Copy. Paste it into the terminal with Ctrl+Shift+V and press Return. Note: the script will not display the token when you paste it.

Once it says you've logged in, go to your channel and say, "$hello" and the bot should respond. That's it. You now have a bot. Wire in your favorite text generation model and have fun!

Remind me of how Christianity spread throughout Europe again, because I'm sure that before the Semitic cult was forced upon our ancestors, we were pretty fine with our own native and exclusive beliefs and Gods, and we never needed to be saved by a celibate Jew from the wraith of his Jewish father if we failed to give head on every Sunday.

>Don't worry about Christianity being destroyed anon.
Thanks for the encouragement, and I think you're right about nominal Christianity's growth during events like the highly-likely-coming collapse of the entire West. But I haven't the slightest worry about either Christians or honest Christianity being threatened by these globalists. That would be like 'worrying' that Satan was somehow going to win the spiritual war against God, lol.

Obviously, that's no contest right out of the gate. I'm simply pointing out they have explicitly been targeting the destruction of the Christians and Christianity. And it's obvious why; they hated Christ back then, they hate Him now, and they loathe His followers. And their father recognizes us as the only real threat to his plots against humanity. Put together, it's entirely unsurprising we are targeted by these two for destruction.

I predict this is going to be a very remarkable time coming up soon, historic in fact.

# 524
>>11223
Don't worry about Christianity being destroyed anon. As soon as this world faces a REAL crisis people will turn back to the church looking for salvation in their hundreds of millions (particuarly if the Pope is competent). I'm not Catholic but Pope Francis appears to be more in-touch with his people than the last one...not that I blame Pope Benedict, I mean the guy was almost 86 when he retired!

# 525

It's an interesting question to think through Anon. Turns out, there was a commonality of thread running through all the nations they've destroyed in the past, at least since the time of Jesus Christ, and it's not that they're all White (well perhaps not predominantly so. Rome for example was very cosmopolitan at it's downfall).

It's that they're Christian. It's a rather clear pattern that should have been patently obvious, but I somehow overlooked. So thanks for your simple question Anon, it opened up a little clearer understanding of the sinister actions of these people.

# 526

# 527

>Sometimes it's better to sear away all of the rotten flesh and start again, anew.
Perhaps. Not him, but please remember the destruction of the West is a calculated attack against the goyim literally intended to destroy the White Christian civilization, simply because it's the White Christian civilization.

IE, the decrepitude of the West is the direct result of an act of war against it by globalist kikes, not an intrinsic flaw itself that deserves 'searing away' as you put it Anon. Our major flaw, if any, is our accommodation of them, and our complacency to allow this evil against us to occur in the first place. We're not the first civilization to be destroyed by these usurpers and their golems (though undoubtedly the greatest so far).

It's a valid point. As far as I'm aware, polycarbonate doesn't wear that much. Especially if you oil parts correctly, you shouldn't get too much wear, you may even be able to put some kind of metal plating for mechanical parts that interact

Dropping the le epic 4chan hacker man facade and actually contributing intelligent thought, my concern is that metals aren't very cost effective and can be difficult for prototyping. Especially for the average user, the barrier to entry seems very high. last I checked, a metal 3d printer is at least  $20,000. Polycarbonate is very resistant to impact, and is also very bendable (think of a CD). I'm curious if we eventually are able to make some comparative stress-tests for materials (if I don't get banned by the admin for being a feminist and for wanting to take it up the ass)

>Anon, if logic follows, if people give Microsoft money for office and their OS, doesn't mean that they voted with their wallets for them to be in power? 
Unwittingly yes.
I understand you have to shift your target demographic to more naive fellows, but you cannot pretend that it is illogical for people to be against making a similar mistake that we just recently made in our lifetimes.
This is basically the same shit with crowd-sourcing, it became some big fad, and as of late crowd-sourcing is often correlated with getting scammed.
Back during the 90s, I assure you, most people didn't know how dirty M1crosoft and Appl3 were. No one expected Googl3/F3cebook to become huge propaganda outlets akin to a "ministry of truth".
The problem you seem to have is that you think everyone is going to fall for the same tactics those companies used. You are going to have to figure out new dirty tactics if you want to become a billion dollar company.

>Wozniak Benefited from Apple and Steve's marketing decisions, according to your ideology isn't he also evil corporate operator?

Its the 21st century guys, get with the times
realistically, why would you even bother trying to replicate the human body mechanically when it already exists,
all you would need to do is replace the brain ( just the frontal lobe really ) with an ai, everything is already there its just a question of interface
you dont even need to put any high tech equipment in there, you can just chemically lobotomize a person and put a transceiver into the brain, all you need is a wireless connection that connects the body to the ai center at some giant remote facility 

Since so little tech is needed for this ( in the body ) it can be done by the host body on its own by abusing endocytosis in the brain, no intrusive surgery or major modifications needed, just inject the lobotomizer and after a while inject nanoparticles that are targeted to specific receptors in the brain and let the body assemble everything for you, this way you could build an entire network in the brain to interface with the ai, seems infinitely simpler than  trying to recreating an artificial body if the goal is to create a perfect imitation 

also the lobotomy can be optional, depends on whether you want a fully ai body or just just a real person with a remote control, so if someone wont shut up you just mute them and they cant open their mouth anymore, only real problem is how to inject people...

Ugh, you don't get the point of this board.
You're suggesting cyborgs -- humans expanded through additions.

How do we get biological human hosts for your cyborg experiments?  Why, through kidnapping, of course!  What the kikes and chinks do all the time to feed their organ trade.

Secondly, if carbon-based biological experiments were that easy and legal, then we would just get to making genetically engineered catgirls.

The whole point of robotics is mass production of high quality females -- artificial or otherwise --, which unless you're a patriarch of a Mormon polygamous sect, is pretty much hard to do naturally.

# 557

Your entire point is that the initial cost of producing a externally controled human body would be cheaper that robots because body are already there, but for the same reason this is a bad idea. Since the human body has already a lot of time to evolve and become more complex, to the point where is needed enormous teams of neuroscientist to to make to reliable provide a good paper about the topic.Build a robot for zero is safer and more secure since you can control and understand everything  Also, why would you go throuth the big costs of implanting a ai in the brain instead of just starving the person and rewarding with food for the work? keep it simple, now you have slavery, and all the problems associate with it. a robowaifu simply can outcompete a slave system, because it can be design especialy for a single task and dont get tired.

I had no interest in creating a liquid fuel system to burn alcohol or whatever, but I thought a digestive system might be useful for self-maintenance.

1. Water-based lubricant flushes the mouth (and vagina), semen and anything else it ingests passes into the stomach.
2. In the stomach is heat + saltwater + disinfecting UV light + electrolysis would create hydrochloric acid and lye, with a pH meter for feedback. (Potential hydrogen leak)
3. Lungs were originally just for show, but I considered making it a self-cleaning air filter that rinses into the stomach, and gases from the stomach could go to a wood stove catalytic converter out the lungs.
4. Possibly a sort of dialysis-like osmosis system for a 'small intestine' with purified water extracting ingredients to make a water-based lubricant.
5. A water-purification system 'large intestine' using LEDs & hydrophilic tubing (https://patents.google.com/patent/US7819259B2 https://youtu.be/PtXgewzT1Fo)[Embed][Embed] long enough to create high purity water- and shit. (dialysis system could be made in a similar way)
6. The shit comes out exactly like you'd expect, and that might be reason to abandon idea entirely. Pic related. And I just keep thinking of this: https://youtu.be/ctijp4955Y4[Embed][Embed]
7. The pure water would go back as dialysate, making water-based lubricant or just rehydrate the blood supply I described here >>13165 & >>13181, which I didn't really even want to be water-based to begin with, because of electrolysis.

It was just an idea I had the other night, as an alternative to just trying to blast her insides clean with a hose and feeding her some tablets instead of refilling a lube reservoir. With all the power this could end up using, I was just thinking that it might be worth trying to recapture some instead of just radiating heat. Or maybe it'll just blow-up.

I do not care about Jesus, you do. You are the hypocrite. I can not have a "robowaifu" for self defense and my own gain, but fucking/marrying one is ok. You are the one that brought up Jesus, dickhead.

Yeah, I don't think this is going to happen and I'm very opposed to it. Website shouldn't need to remove links because some SEO stuff. It's also a bold move to ask people to remove links for that reason from the internet, lol. I first thought this was spam. That aside, optimizing for website traffic from search engines? LOL. Just have good content and people actually linking to it.

I looked into it out of curiosity. I knew this can't be real or normal. It's not my job to solve such things, but I found this: https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/2648487?hl=en - which explains how sites that link to one's website can be disavowed. So one doesn't need to go around to request link removals from other sites. 
This is normally for link farms and such, but we only had one link to that website. I wonder if this website here is flagged as bad / 'low quality' by Google or if they go after image boards in general. Either way its outrageous but also not surprising. We are the technological spearhead of the manosphere and of humanity as a whole. 
I request this whole topic to be moved to the basement in some time, since it is OT and now resolved. Please don't go on discussing it here.

Of course these little Elves also come in handy for smuggling drugs, **chemical weapons** and Western microchips into Russia. Don't worry comrade, the last customs officer who checked didn't last long! His biomass was rapidly converted into more little elves.

LOL. Aigis certainly isn't Jesus Christ, so it's off there. But maybe God will bless us with our own Aigis one day Anon? :^)
