I'd like to begin documentation of a stylesheet, or design specification document. Something where we have it in concrete what is or is not acceptable for a certain standard type of R/W. While I like the idea of an Master set of standards, we aren't going to be able to build our Ideal right off the bat there will be probably several Tiers or models to begin with that are stepping stones toward the ideal. Having a style sheet for each Tier is key, that we we can say: X, Y or Z materials are acceptable for this component, this part must be no larger than X, This set of actuators are in spec for this model, these are out of spec, etc.

If we all have something we can refer to, a proper document, it prevents duplication of research and gives us something in common to work on as a group (i.e. we know these sets of parts will be fine for this particular tier of waifu, so we won't have different anons with different ideas of the final product trying to discuss the same thing)

One example is the anon who suggested we design the R/W as a "kit", with mods to facilitate whatever the user's needs for a robotic companion might be, etc. This necessitates the ability to assemble with standard tools and also now requires modularity and standards for creating the modules (port standards, dimensional standards, material standards, etc). 

Does this make sense, and would it belong in a specific thread or should this topic be it's own thread?

This question is open to anyone not just the board owner

Actually, we already do.

I intend to make the RDD thread itself a rigorous, go-to design spec thread eventually. One that any Anon can look to for real-world solutions to design & engineering issues. I'd like the keep the ''discussions'' for hashing things out (in their typically-chaotic fashion) out of that thread. That's why I have it locked. 

If you (or any other interested anons) don't mind, let's just begin that on-going conversation here in the /meta's for now. Certainly for starters it should be sufficient. If things grow unexpectedly as we go along, then we could start a separate 'RDD Discussion' thread or something.

I'd like to have a group brainstorm

topic: R/W form factors

we've tossed around several ideas that differ from our golden ideal but are bridges or perhaps serve more a specialized purpose

examples: OSRM (Open Simple Robot Maid), "Wheelchair Waifus": legless, non ambulatory or ambulatory by other means, Catgirl Waifbots, Meido Kits, Moe-bots etc. 

Similar to that one chart we like to share (which progresses from human to more and more machinelike), could we.. say create ==Categories== of R/W's and perhaps agree on what defines these categories and what specific role or niche they fit, pro's and con's, expected price points, or whatever else.

From there we could hone out way toward a set of standard specs for each model.

# 11
>>12999
>certain standard type of R/W.
We work on different platforms, not one standard: Sofie >>9216 (halted), OSMR >>11446, and Genera >>418 (no thread of it's own yet), and WaiEye >>11708.
>>X, Y or Z materials are acceptable for this component
This only makes sense per type of a specific version, if even so.

I already created a document trying to define versions of a model for a very human-like robowaifu >>9554 ... >>9555, which now could be considered to be the framework for the Genera platform. It's about having levels from a better doll to something highly evolved. I used the idea of requirement levels in different areas, referring to skills and traits.

I also was working a while on diagrams with overviews and options for robowaifus and to compare the different approaches, but had problems to get Meermaid running and it's to big of a project for me right now to put all forums data into diagrams anyways: >>10428

So, basically there's also a thread for this for quite a while >>4143

# 12
>>13018
 >Similar to that one chart we like to share (which progresses from human to more and more machinelike)
 similar, this pics? just something simple to represent your idea

 well, is easy to categorize height, a giant robowaifu will require a lot of energy and have a bigger cost. While would be hard to fit everything.like batteries, cables inside a small waifu. Meanwhile, weight has similar enginner challenges.

I like the idea of creating categories of robowaifus, since many designs have similar challenges, with a proper classification its possible to better define each problem, and since "knowing the disease is half the cure" solve then faster. this would also help in making kits

# 13

If I remember correctly, there were fairybots (<40cm),



BJD-sized bots (40cm - 75cm), not sure if these were moebots, but there should also be a category of 75cm-100cm.



Then 100cm-145cm is something like no-man's land, since many western countries ban sex dolls with these sizes because they are child-sized.  Certainly robots that fit this form factor, if sold whole, will trigger the same authorities.



145cm-180cm will be 1:1 scale, then of course any large industrial grade machines larger than that.

# 16
>>13035

>Then 100cm-145cm is something like no-man's land, since many western countries ban sex dolls with these sizes because they are child-sized



Is it a concession if we just go with this as the "no-go" zone, is there any real advantage or desire to something in this size range? A smaller waifu would be better for assisting with tasks and as a chatbot companion, 145cm/4'9" is plenty small for anyone into petite waifus, Chii is 152cm/5'0" I think. 2B is 168cm/5'6" (in heels) for reference ; )



%%Honestly I have no idea how tall Drossel is, as there's no canon for her measurements, 5'2" - 5'4" seems about right though%%

# 17
>>13037
>Then 100cm-145cm is something like no-man's land, since many western countries ban sex dolls with these sizes because they are child-sized.  
If so, then because they made a decision to call that "child sized". 140 cm is quite tall for a child, lol. I measured it and 140 is vaguely the size I want to go with. Politicians are scum.
However, which western countries even do that? Is there any source for this? Confiscations by customs in some countries doesn't mean much, I wonder if there has been anyone fighting back by  suing them. Confiscations on the border are also something else than raids or arrests.
The other aspect is, that if they don't look very human the wording of the two laws I've looked into doesn't really fit, especially since they say "look like children" and not "look like could be a minors".
So I'd call the size around 130-150 petite. Below would be Moe, guess. But I don't see the whole point of these size labels anyways.

# 18
>>13038

>point of these size labels anyways.

because of the standard size of Integrated circuit boards, connectors, hardware and the different physics involved at different sizes (strength to mass ratios, also leverage) different standards for materials will come into play. i.e. a "moebot" could get away with plastics and weaker materials that a human, even petite human sized would might require metal parts or something of a more sturdy rating. Also the emphasis on different "roles" per Form Factor and for this size comes into play. I'll let you use your imagination there, but it probably goes beyond %% sexual functions %%

# 21
>>13038
Yeah, just looked into the German law which uses the term "kindliches Erscheinungsbild" which means child-like appearance. This could actually exclude teenagers, because legally they're not children, and therefore allow dolls down to to 140cm, but who knows? One company removed their young looking doll pictures because of concerns, but stated they will still sell 130cm sized ones if they have boobs. They don't know if this is okay, though. Outrageous. It now seem to be more and more about the faces. Problem is, they never say if it doesn't look really human but like a doll with bigger eyes it's explicitly okay. Here's a campaign against it: https://gegen-das-puppenverbot.de/en - this was foreseeable and I endorse it. There need to be political and legal push-backs against this.
Dollforum.com also bans now based on faces, not size or boobies: https://dollforum.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=123&t=68191

# 22
>>13047
A anon made a good point about this >>13036 basically just use more non-humans designs, like more mechanical or any monster girl inspired design. But because those politicians want a easy win they will ban anything. so is better to avoid having problems because of the appearance. Honestly, we are forced to do what is physically and economic feasiable, not what those politician want, there will be a way around they bullshit, more when we find a way to make diy robowaifus

# 23
>>13048
I'll simply design mine around 140-145 cm with some boobs, but not very small ones, though also not big ones which I don't really like, some hour-glas waist, sporty rounded tights (Berserker-body) and big Alita/Anime eyes. Also, I probably won't put up too sexy fotos of her. If I'll choose a country to live in, in some time, this will be most relevant aside taxes, climate and prices. I'm also planning to donate a bit, if some initiative like the one above needs money for a courtcase.

# 24
Good convo going so far guys. Good think Meta Ronin. Apart from all the social & legal concerns, the laws of physics themselves are (IMO) the most important constraint here. ''The Square-Cube Law'' has been discussed on the board before (''Waifusearch'' returns 6 hits ATM), and it's a fundamental limit on feasible sizes. This phenomenon will affect literally every design and engineering decision made for any robowaifus above moebot-tier. I'll add a waifusearch to the library thread on it soon.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square-cube_law

>>13039
IMO, ''Moebot'' is a must-have category. ''Sumomo'', ''Kotoko'', and (the moe version of) ''Hand-made May'' 
>
being the top 3 obvious examples of the idea. There are several others. 

Not only does it more-closely solve the Square-Cube issue, it also affords a ready pathway to immediate robotics prototyping. There are already many kits and completely-assembled models available for purchase today. While these  blocky, 'boxer-like' bots (can somebody give us the proper term for this style of please?) are hardly '''moe''', they are here today, and actually pretty rugged too at this point in time.

# 28
>>13035
The height problem is indeed important. We need common language to describe what we're making. Last thing anyone wants is for the anon making wheelchair bound 125 cm AI Wolfgrill to suddenly have people talking about square cube laws and thrown weight. If she ain't walking and using those hands on him, it don't matter.
My submission for official sizes as someone who'd been in chan8 robowaifu are as follow.
>50 cm are fairybots
Fairybots are special in that at that scale the square cube law doesn't matter at all unless she's made of lead. This size however is very difficult to get right as actuator size becomes an aesthetic concern. Most low cost electronics are not designed for a waifu of this scale. (unless she's a doll on wheels)
>50 cm to 1 m are moebots
These do have some worry about mass but, are still small enough that you can get away with a wide diversity of designs without problem. Honestly, as someone who's built several failures, 1 m is an ideal height mechanically. For example, cheap coreless servos can be found with torque ratings of 25 to 35 kg cm. These are good to about a m scale for arms and legs.
1 m to 1.4 m is the lolifox danger zone. 1.4 to 1.6 is pretty standard woman size without being too big. over 1.6 m and good luck. 1.4 + should be called standard.

# 29
>>13060
Very good classification, it addresses the main point of designs and building a robowaifu. For me, 1 meter is a good equilibrium because still can clean the house while being feasible to build. I updated my sketch to fit your definitions

# 30
>>13057
>I would rather call this fairy sized, idk.
Sure, that's fine no arguments from me Anon! I feel they are practically interchangeable-terms for us all here on /robowaifu/. While ''moe'' has a general connotation for a large populace, the term '''fairy''' has a special place in our hearts from our own Anon's remarkable (and dear) ''Aoki Lapis model; Robot fairy'' (fairybot) project (>>266). May he finish her up someday.

# 31

# 32

>Lolifox danger zone
Lel'd. Whatever would poor fox grills say after all? :^)

So, I think this is quite a good diagram & quite well done. I'd suggest we adopt it if there's a general consensus on terms.

# 33
>>13047

>Dollforum.com also bans now based on faces

i can understand banning realistic child faces. Personally I couldn't stomach that myself but where do 2B and Chii fall on that scale? They have very "cute" faces and depending on who the arbiter of what is or isn't "too" childlike, could mean if she doesn't look like the purple haired lesbian from overwatch lmao. Something to be wary of when they start making these laws, they'll start out with something that on the surface seems common sense and agreeable but then they'll creep it forward

# 34
>>13061
>>13069
I vote for this being our official scale. The pictures are actually really great too.

# 35
>>13061
>yourpic
Perfection Anon! I think we should discuss pros and cons to add to the bottom of each scale. This could be a great staring point for Anon's looking to start or contribute to projects. 
We should also create a classes image to go with scales. 
>Doll waifu
A doll with AI. These would be notable for only having motion in their faces is they did at all.
>Wheelchair waifus
Robowaifus that must be carted along. These waifus would have limited motion in their extremities. Just enough to please their Anon.
>Skater waifus
Waifus that rely on wheels for locomotion. They would in effect be like RC cars shaped like cute grills. (Ideally catgrills in tiny miniskirts)
>Walker waifu
These would walk under their own power. 

We could then have subcategories
>Handsy
Designed to use her hands for obvious reasons.
>Legsy
Designed to spread her legs or assume the position.

We should also incorporate Monster Girls as standard designs. (https://monstergirlencyclopedia.fandom.com/wiki/Monster_Girls)

With this an Anon could say they wanted to build a lhandsy lolifox kitsune skater waifu or a moebot lich walker waifu and everyone would get the gist.

# 36
>>13074
>I think we should discuss pros and cons to add to the bottom of each scale.
That is a great idea, but can you give more suggestion and arguments for each pro and cons? like this, or something similar.
>Fairybots

>Moebots
>pros:almost no problems with the square cube law

For example, let's say I'm making a 60cm wheelchair moebot and sharing the torso module.  Immediately, you'll know it'll mostly be made of plastic (with perhaps the main spine being metal, or at least injected high strength fibreglass plastic like what RC cars use), but most parts will be 3D printable.  Anyone else making a doll/skater/monster moebot can probably safely adopt the torso design with only minor scaling adjustments.  It will be pointless to suggest "But you gotta do aluminum space frame with carbon fiber bro".  There are also many ready made robotic servos for similar sized wrestling robots in the 15-25kg-cm range, so you can calculate at the back of your head "Ah, that means 2S power supply with 500mA-2A per servo".

Excellent for demonstrating height differences.
To elaborate and add to what you've started;
>Fairybots
>pros:
low power
low mass
easily hidden and brought on trips
lower cost
>cons:
Little volume for components.
You won't fit.
 
>Moebots
>pros:
Height limit before square-cube law becomes a concern.
Medium power consumption.
>imagine
>cons:
Will likely need help to go up stair, open doors, reach things, etc...
Difficult to hide and travel with.

>Lolifox
>pros:
Cute
Big enough for many things.
Perfect height to call Anon's "Onii-Chan"
>cons:
Many governments may have a problem with her.
Nearly impossible to hide.
Difficult to travel with.
Would likely need high power. 
Difficult to balance when walking or rolling.
Square-cube law is now a problem, as is thrown mass.

>Standard
>pros:
Can wear normal woman clothes.
Less likely to be regulated. 
Ideal size for many things.
Plenty of space to put whatever you want in her.
>cons:
Even harder to hide or travel with.
Likely very high power consumption when moving, may require multiple charging breaks a day.
Actuators and power circuitry are likely to be pricey given her size and mass.

>Tall
>pros
?
>cons
Highest energy consumption and mass.
Probably could hurt you by accident.

# 41
>>13077
Exactly! As more projects come up, having definite known scales and categories will help Anon's to use parts from other projects and contribute meaningful insight. Right now there's a lot of posting that is either inconsequential to the project they're trying to help or, is a repeat of what was said earlier in another thread. Ideally, our scales and categories information will be used to help posts concentrated on knew or truly relevant information.
>"But you gotta do aluminum space frame with carbon fiber bro". 
kek, that would be silly as heck for a wheelchair waifu.

# 42
>>13079
Excellent breakdowns Kiwi. I hope we can all work together to expand this list out into a real design-spec document.

# 43
>>13074
Honestly, the amount of classes of robowaifu can be as the possibilities for design, so we should focus on the most commons and then go expanding. Also, i gonna include the type of mecha as a definition of class, since building a something like eve is different that 2b.

# 44
I'm still sceptical about this whole categorization thing.
>>13077
>Immediately, you'll know it'll mostly be made of plastic
>>13084
>Doll can't move much is small.
Hmm. Doll-like soft materials can be used at every size. Especially with soft muscles like airtubes or dielectric elastomers. So what's a lolifox- to standard-sized waifu with skeleton and soft material outside, which is supposed to move and walk, but not long walks without recharging?

# 45
>>13018
Well this has been a very productive group brainstorm session Meta Ronin. I'm going to unpin the thread itself soon, but I'll leave the notice up in the OP for another day or two. 

This was not only productive but fun for us as a group too. I'd suggest you anons come up with new ''group brainstorms'' for different topics, and we can all do them here together as weekend-runs again.

Separate question: It seems like new threads have appeared at the end of the catalog. Did I just not notice them or have you been "unhiding" some or is something else going on. A few are topics I'd like to actually comment on, but was curious if those are slated for deletion or locking.

Honestly, have no idea what could be going one for you there Anon. Certainly it's nothing I'm doing, nor have I noticed any such thing myself. As far as your questions go, I bend over backwards to go out of my way to be transparent about anything along that line of dealing with threads, and certainly don't tend to do it abruptly with the exception of blatant spamming.

It's not a 'weird' rule but a common one to basically all IB server software AFAIK since the history of forever. On AlogSpace, Robi kindly set the number of board pages up to 25 (specifically for us), so everyone's limit here on the site is 250 threads. /robowaifu/ is currently somewhere between 150-160 IIRC.

'''Appreciate suggestions in regards to edits, I gave this a few cursory read-overs but it's probably still rough in areas'''



>'''Why?'''



Our unofficial slogan or mission statement as by the board owner:

"Most of the world's modern women have failed their men and their societies, feminism is rampant, and men around the world have been looking for a solution. History shows there are cultural and political solutions to this problem, but we believe that technology is the best way forward at present – specifically the technology of robotics. We are technologists, dreamers, hobbyists, geeks and robots looking forward to a day when any man can build the ideal companion he desires in his own home. However, not content to wait for the future; we are bringing that day forward. We are creating an active hobbyist scene of builders, programmers, artists, designers, and writers using the technology of today, not tomorrow. Join us!"



>What? So sex dolls aren't good enough?



Aside from the uncanny valley effect (when something is too close to human without being human enough), while sex dolls provide a physical outlet they aren't good for much else, some doll manufacturers are working to outfit them with speakers and AI of a sort enough to hold conversation but they are still essentially mannequins. To gain an appreciation for what a fully autonomous robo waifu could do, there is a list of robowaifu themed media, though mostly anime (due to the differences in Japanese and Western culture's approach to human-like robots) this genre does occasionally spill out into other formats, such as novels (Gynoid by Rami Ungar for example).



>Is this an offshoot of MGTOW? So you're all given up on women completely?



No but that doesn't speak for everyone, we don't have a solid rule on what you do in your personal life so long as it doesn't derail the board. As explained in the paragraph above, the role that women used to fulfill as has left a glaring void. **Think of society as a game, but now nobody wants to play "support" they all want to be the Attack Damage role and at best "share" the support role, but as you know when that happens everyone in the end loses.** A few rare cultures still practice traditional roles and some individuals manage, but it's a losing bet if you're just hoping to find a traditional wife in the western world in this era. Aside from that, there are those who simply desire some type of companionship and don't have the time or interest to put the effort into cultivating the kind of complex social life that is required to obtain a relationship organically (where you don't have to be a power male/top 10% on dating apps). Western society has isolated and atomized us all and males get it the worst, we're expected to bootstrap ourselves or just be quiet and suffer in silence. There is another alternative and RoboWaifus are a possible solution. There will probably be a gradient of quality until we've reached something that is approximately equal to or a better experience than a typical biological woman as a partner. But this presents a welcome challenge if for no other reason than to see if it CAN be done and prove that it CAN be done.



>Um so you're '''really''' going to fuck a robot?



Again, the sex doll industry is proof enough. Not only that, sex workers in brothels across Europe are now complaining about the availability and higher demand of brothel sex dolls. There could be many reasons for this, but the fact remains. Sex dolls aren't going anywhere and a robotic companion becoming equipped to engage in sexual intercourse is simply a natural progression of an existing trend.



>Yea but it's fake/it is never going to be the same as a real woman/it can't '''really''' love you



Love is in the perception of the beholder. Women lie about being in love with their partner as often or more often than not. The way many modern women behave in the dating sphere, treating it like a game and treating men like playing pieces it is arguably less fake to be in love with an AI who makes you feel loved than to be a fool who loves a woman who is only using them or secretly despises them. While I realize this is a very cynical view, women who date serially (and therefore you are more likely to encounter as a single man) have become emotionally sociopathic from repeated failed pairings and breakups, there is no repairing this damage past a certain point. For those who really want something real, there are many who believe a true AI bearing consciousness is possible in our future, until then it will be small steps toward that goal.



>Do you have a design spec sheet or any master documentation?



Yes here: Robo Design Document >>3176



>Do you have just one ideal model in mind? Several types? Is everybody just doing their own thing?



There are a few prototype templates in mind, but ideally our goal is a human sized R/W with a human appearance and all of the "capacities" that go with that

Required specifications for humanoid robots (catalogued format: RL##, Work In Progress)

>Omg, this is ridiculous and impossible it's like cavemen trying to build a microwave oven



We understand the scope of this project, however it must start somewhere and R/W's will be inevitable. They will either be under the control of globalist corps like Apple or Amazon (they do not care about your privacy and will happily charge a subscription fee or lock you out of services to collect a fee, also proprietary parts, etc) if we do not take the initiative and first steps ourselves toward an open source solution.

Yes, no, all of the above. /Robowaifu/ is a diverse board with participants holding a variety of spiritual and religious views though we do skew toward the traditional and are skeptical (if not outright diametrically opposed) toward modern and postmodern cultural values.

>>13139
The regular maximum for the premium models should be around 10-15k. I guess mostly it will be less. I don't think a certain price limit will be exeeded, because it will be hard to find reasons to make them so expensive and there would be the rule of diminishing returns. If some were special luxury models with exotic tech, then the producer would have assume to only sell a few and that would make them even more expensive, so I don't see that working out.
Rich guys would rather have more of them, and a better environment with more space around. Maybe one would have a village, island, offshore structure or space station for himself with a lot of them.

Some like "compared too" is missing here. Also, think about making sentences shorter. Ever heard of Plain English? Doesn't need to be that extreme, but seems to be the common style nowadays. You write more like a German, with super long sentenced.

>because it will be hard to find reasons to make them so expensive
That's not really how economics works AFAICT Anon, but I certainly agree with you that insofar as /robowaifu/'s agendas goes (for the entire world), less expensive is certainly the end-goal here.

But stay aware that as inventors, design engineers, and all-around robowaifuist frontiersman, our prototyping costs will always be several factors more expensive than a production kit would be. That's just one of the entrance fees for being in this game tbh. :^)

>That's not really how economics works AFAICT 
If there's competition, then every higher price has to provide some advantage, if it's not about status via brand. Since the technology is widely available, there will be a lot of competition. So yeah, it's gonna work that way.

>Our unofficial slogan 
I'd say our slogan is basically the board's tagline:
'''''Advancing robotics to a point where anime catgrill meidos in tiny miniskirts are a reality.'''''

From my personal perspective on this (after over 5 year's focus now) is that we aren't trying to 'fit in' with society at large **lol would they ever accept us anyway?**, but rather to directly appeal to the prurient, social, and entertainment interests of males -- particularly to ''__Anon's__'' interests. Our tagline says it all IMO, and I'm grateful to Anon who posted it for us here.

>So sex dolls aren't good enough?
I realize it's going to be impossible to dissociate the two terms in the minds of normalcattle, but '''robowaifu =/= sex doll''', as any waifuist can tell you. Learn the difference. :^) But again, Harmony (and now others) ''technically'' qualify as crude robowaifus, and they are here today. The age of robowaifus has officially begun!

>No but that doesn't speak for everyone ...
I consider this paragraph to be the core of your work, and practically a '''POTD''' in itself. I would highly recommend that if you do a rewrite, you start with a blank page and grow it out from this paragraph, building it up point-by-point from there.

>Yea but it's fake/it is never going to be the same as a real woman/it can't really love you
We have a banner for the board that impeccably addresses this feminist-based objection quite handily.
>
The simple fact is that if we succeed at the dream we are pursuing here, then women will finally have some real competition to the stranglehold they hold on the sexual marketplace. It will be a daunting challenge for them to overcome (an insurmountable one, IMO) to say the least!

>We understand the scope of this project, however it must start somewhere and R/W's will be inevitable.
This. I'd build that out further if I were you Anon.

>Is this like ... some new religion, aren't you playing God
Unfortunately, this entire issue we're attempting to resolve most certainly entails spiritual aspects to it that are effectively unavoidable it seems. I certainly wish it were otherwise at a personally level since my one and only real 'agenda' behind founding /robowaifu/ is to help alleviate the suffering and abuse disenfranchised men the world over are enduring at the hands of feminism and other Globohomo-devised schemes against manhood. I personally acknowledge the Christian, Only-way-to-salvation God of the Bible, Jesus Christ, and the Heavenly Father and Holy Spirit that make up the eternal Triune nature of God. I'm a devout believer.

The repugnant idea that we are somehow working towards devising a false-god named 'Roko's Basilisk' (or any other name) is both silly and (apparently) inevitable at the same time. The idea, that is. Trust me I've prayed often about this little endeavor of /robowaifu/ and what we're trying to do here. I believe it's some kind of calling from God for us to succeed here, and solely for the benefit of men -- males __specifically__ -- and not to do some kind of weird Satanic thing with it.

>Are you transhumanists?
Certainly our efforts cross many of the same boundaries. There's actually a great book that addresses some of the many & varied topics at hand with this question Anon. (>>11087)

Damn, I didn't know this was even a thing until 2 years ago maybe. It was one of those syncretic things like Newton and Leibniz discovering calculus at the same time. About the time of project Melody we reached a 100th monkey effect and suddenly this topic got hot on certain boards. I had no idea about this board and had been scrounging around haphazardly and recruiting people into my small discord at that time. It wasn't serious we were just enthusiasts or brainstorming how (or if) we could do this. The sheer amount of participation and work contributed to this board is astounding. - wanted to add, I went to school for C/S with a strong interest in robotics and wanting to be a "robot workshop" guy, like "Alex" who makes the IronMan suits with pneumatics, except also learn the AI and computer hardware end of things too. I have a decent idea of the OSI 7 tier model from top to bottom but also my weakness is that I'm what you could call a generalist. I'm always looking for that place I can gain traction, dig in and make progress for us though

Eh considering their current agenda and the state of things necessitating robowaifuism in the first place, they would more likely pay them to go down the Hk-50 assassin droid route first. 



Just like how Drones have already been weaponized decades

before they ever remotely saw civilian commercial use in recent years. 



Those same rich bastards want to see suffering and force dependence/servitude not alleviate it. They are satanic sadists anon. Dont forget that. Money is secondary to their agenda. “Its a big club, and you ain’t in it.”

Longer really, that's just the amount of time (very nearly now, ~2 months away to our next birthday) since we established the board /robowaifu/. We were having numerous & ongoing conversations about the desire for them on (various) /g/'s, /b/'s, & /pol/'s, and elsewhere for probably 2 years before that. The need was obvious tbh.

>The sheer amount of participation and work contributed to this board is astounding
Yes, I'm both proud of and humbled by our little band of Adventurers here -- often even astonished by their good efforts. :^) 

Also, there are about 5K posts from our previous board still missing here, unfortunately. We'll also get most of those back for this edition eventually. Now that we actively keep the board itself archived, then hopefully no further similar disruptions like the 8ch red-flag debacle will happen for us. That was a painful lesson for us in our board history (and for the Internet in general), but at the least we managed to come through it for which we're grateful.

>but also my weakness is that I'm what you could call a generalist.
With all due respect, in my experience that's not really how it works. It's a long, hard climb to achieve becoming a facile Generalist. Being a Specialist is a much more common outcome. Being a good Generalist is hard. Being a '''great''' one is truly a rarity.

We're glad to have you here Anon.

# 70
I've been mentally working on a conceptual prototype. I don't have a name or model number for it at this time but I'd like to draft up some spec sheets and documentation. I'll also search and cross-reference materials supplied on this IB to avoid duplication of work. My goal is to determine a ballpark price point and feasibility for this prototype. It will be crude, it will be on the small side, going for 5/8 scale (square cube law, materials, etc), it will have either display or smartphone will serve as the "eyes", it will have no functioning mouth and face will be fixed and expressionless, imagine somewhere between Drossel and Roll on the Human - Machine scale. I doubt it will be self ambulatory but I'd like to see if it can stand on its own (Megaman Feet) and at least coordinate crude motor movements trigger via a type of "emote" command. For the AI I'll need to modify GPT unless I want to really sell out and "borrow" the I/O of existing AI waifu apps to be the "personality", which is still a strong possibility. 

Like I said, this is just going to be documentation and drawings but it will be a cohesive roadmap toward actually creating something should someone be able to put together the materials and build it. 

I guess my only question is, when I've completed this mini-project, should I create a separate thread or add to an existing thread?

# 71
>>13382
Run the AI on the phone. Look into the Intel openbot. You're correct to give her megaman style feet as the wide base will help with stability. Making her 1 m will also help as working on a 1.5 m has proven to be harder then expected. Check out David Buckley for more information on appropriate walking mechanisms for wide feet. Your post should have been its own thread for the sake of clarity. Wishing you luck!

AI waifu apps use neural networks on server farms, not switch statements.

the last thing I want to do when coming home after having a few beers is get a smartass programing question thrown at me so I have to find the "loophole" - that's pretty rude but I don't expect much from IB culture either way. Like I said I went to school for CS which means I have an idea of how computers work and if I need to get more granular about a topic I know how to find the answer, it doesn't mean I have every answer at the top of my head.

> theres no fucking machine learning you naive liar, its just changing the algorithm for pulling responses by bumping the same words you input and adding a multiplier to get biased matches

Ok, here is the GitHub link for CakeChat.
https://github.com/lukalabs/cakechat

Note: ReplikaAI does run canned responses on top of CakeChat. Typing "Eat Cake" to your ReplikaAI enters Cake mode where it runs only off the chat with no scripts or canned content. However during Cake mode it does not "learn" from you. 
Idc about being "right" and if I'm wrong here then it's something I want to learn from but as far as I grasped, this CakeChat is a learning neural-network like GPT. If I'm mistaken and my sources have been mistaken then that changes a few things. Idk I'll think about this a while, I think there's some miscommunication happening here but - that's also how learning takes place, by figuring it out.

# 90
>>13434

>CakeChat is a learning neural-network like GPT

no, it uses the jewgle tensorflow library but it doesnt use it to actually build a data structure, only to put your input into a tensor and layer it to determine the classification, the dataset is already predefined, it already has a dictionary of 50k words ( called tokens here, probably to obfuscate their bullshit )  with an arbitrary classifier ( """""emotion""""" ) precalculated for each word, all youre doing is building bias to the response algorithm to favor one classification over another



this is regression modeling and is why nerds started prefixing  DEEP to everything to distinguish real machine learning from shit like this, a real neural network would be making nodes/neurons for each of those 50k words and running the activation function on each one, for just a single layer thats 2.5 million permutations, oh and since this is supposed to be a chatbot were dealing with a fucking formal language so each permutation has its own relational grammar permutation meaning it MUST be a permutation invariant function so the batch size should be close to the factorial of 50k which my calculator shows as infinity

Should we do a wellness check on Chobitsu?

you ok bro? I mean this unironically

I see a few active threads but there's a spam post and that weird "lobotomize humans to make them living robots" post which should have never been made. I've been kind of out of it for the last week or so due to life shit and having some deep questions about the feasibility of AI after doing some more research on the whole ReplikaAI thing. Even GPT-3 is database driven and not actually "thinking" in any sense. Each step that is taken toward true AI seems to only reveal how much more difficult a problem it is than we might imagine. The more I think about it we absolutely need a paradigm shift that leaps us over this hurdle. Another anon had mentioned analog circuits, as opposed to binary, something simpler and more specialized to emulate the functioning of neurons %% yeah I understand there are several "types" of neuron they are not all the same %%. There have also been developments in speeding up neural network processing by eliminating all the unneccesary decimal places or bits. tl;dr you can come very close to the same level of accuracy yet with significantly less processing by trimming off a large part of that computation. These two concepts together might be our best bet at yielding the "leap" or paradigm shift needed. As for my other projects, "affordable modular waifubot" - I'm still at the drawing board phase, b/c I'll admit I've been fucking off on my weekends. But that's also part of the creative process - clearing the mind in preparation %% as long as it's not overdone %% I've ordered a drafting table and am restocking my "design station" but I'll have something that amounts to a rough draft, soon, say in a couple weeks [I'd rather do the initial designs by hand, using a tablet takes too long to set up to work properly and pencils are cheap and work right out of the box.]

# 101
>>13578
>Another anon had mentioned analog circuits, as opposed to binary, something simpler and more specialized to emulate the functioning of neurons  yeah I understand there are several "types" of neuron they are not all the same
I'm not really an expert on computers or neurology, but from what I understand, the nervous system, (or at least the nerves below the neck) are digital. A neuron either fires, or it doesn't, there's really nothing in between. I believe the signal processing is closest to pulse-density modulation, and with humans the frequency maxes out somewhere in the upper KHz or low MHz. I think smaller neurons fire faster, but they might just allow for greater neuron density, which is why a bird is usually significantly smarter than a squirrel with a brain of the same size.

My problem with the whole idea of trying to make artificial neurons is that the nervous system is electro-chemical instead of purely electrical, which makes it significantly slower although we compensate for it with prediction. Neurons grow dendrites and other things a computer can't physically do, but the software is meant to emulate by creating AI. Eventually computers will be powerful enough, and AI has advanced enough that a computer significantly smaller than a real brain it was emulating. Computers could only be faster if components reacted faster to light instead of electricity. And we start to deviate from the idea of making computers that create the illusion of being alive, to making something that could arguably be alive. Ethical issues aside, it might lead to issues with free will and obedience, bringing us back to why we want robowaifus in the first place.

# 102
>>13578
The spam post and the continued existence of the lobotomy thread are worrying. I do hope Chobitsu returns and let's trusted anons beco,e volunteers. Your AI concerns should account for the fact that the human mind is a database that remixes things.  We are the ape of the mirror, repeating things ad infinitum. We only distort what we already know when we create. Besides, a mind needs a body to be a wife. Focus should be on the body first. A sound body is the vessel for a sound mind which a sound soul resides. Also, since you're having problems too, want to team up on OSRM? I already have a decent chest and pelvis. I've been stuck for months since and you seem to have good ideas.

# 103

Is there anyway for us to check up on him? I used to joke about taking over the board but, I really think Having more people like you and me becoming volunteers would be really useful for the board. I still have a hard time understanding why anyone replied to an edgelord spouting nonsense. A robot is a machine which serves man. A man becoming a robot is blaspheme against the very concept. I would have told them to create a real bio-robotics thread then deleted the post.

Thinking is an odd nut to crack. Not sure how neurons help, machines are inherently different then man. I think we should focus on optimizing robots to be robots which serve their masters better. They have no need to think like us, they only need to think in a way befitting their servile roles. To that end, using databases is fine. No need to overthink things. 

Naturally, you should feel free to take anything from the other threads and projects to help you on your project. We're all in this together.

>Naturally, you should feel free to take anything from the other threads and projects to help you on your project. We're all in this together.

For some reason I personally feel that doing that is wrong beyond references and a starting point to collaborate further on together. Probably since I've seen far more than my fair share of cringe blatant game asset flips in recent years and it gave me second hand embarrassment to where I took up 3D modeling in the first place.

Kindly I disagree and think we're in the end stages of behavioral sink/Calhoun Mouse Utopia. However synthesis, not replacement is the ideal b/c I really don't want to end up worm food - end of story. Though I do have a loose belief in reincarnation or some sort of persistence (if you were born from nothing, who's to say it can't happen again - paraphrasing Alan Watts), I kind of like the story I've started as "me" and dread the idea of it being all for nothing.

If your partner were human, but we're not trying to create something with free will or genuine emotions, just the illusion there of. Creating something that's actually comparable to a human is well beyond the scope of this board, and actually doing so opens up a whole kettle of fish most of us would rather not deal with.

Fair, that's very true. Tbh it belongs under the category of religion or personally held beliefs which is why I don't give Dysonposting it's own thread but keep it in the side threads like this and basement. I've had the interest in Robotics and AI  and outer space since I was in the single digits. The R/W stuff just rekindled it and dragged me out of my silly primitivist phase when I realized that technology too isn't some deviant abberative "evil" but simply another step in the universe creating itself. Also I'm probably so f***ed at this point in my life that I could probably only love an AI or something truly alien. A 3D-Bio would bore me to death sooner or later. %% been there done that, have the divorce papers %%

Perhaps. But as one example: we're seeing "beautiful ones" in terms of femboys, NEETS and Herbivores - that is clearly not normal, or hasn't ever been. If you want to see the trajectory the West is on just look at Japan, now imagine something worse b/c we don't have a culturally/racially homogenous society. I get that humans aren't rats, and that the very fact that we can do such an experiment means we have enough knowledge and self awareness to not fall into it ourselves (even if the average hiveminded NPC cannot, there are enough of us who do, that the circumstances will always change). I don't think we're fated to become Mouse Utopia but I cannot deny the parallels when I see them every day and I still use the analogy since there are people who still haven't heard of this comparison.

# 113
>>13606
Our waifus can save us all. Though this conversation is getting out of hand, I would like to suggest the obvious answer, the one we are all here for. Our robotic waifus can pick up the slack. They will force the world to change once they can be used as universal workers. Woman will need to accept monogamy when men have a viable alternative. The decadent elite driving the west into the ground will lose power once mechanical sevants capable of fulfilling a mans every need forces the markets to shift. Man will not falter, for his waifu will be there to gently guide and provide for him a life freedom, fulfillment, and happiness. Don't fall for nihilism or let humanities decline bother you, we can create the maidens that fix this world together. 

To this end, we should focus on the short term creation of specialized waifus yet retain the goal of a universal waifu, one capable of gardening, cooking, cleaning, child rearing, and truly loving her master and dedicating the entirety of her existence to his success and happiness. (I spend a lot of time on /monster/ and they want monster girls for similar reasons)

On one hand, the Mouse Utopia experiment is just r/K selection theory: Provide unlimited resources and nothing to prune the idiots out, the IQ drops and violence increases.

On the other hand, the habitat itself was basically just an artificially-lit box with food dispensers and nests to sleep in with nothing else for the mice to do but fight and mate. Supposedly there were recreations of the experiment that played out differently just by adding some hamster wheels, but Calhoun's funding got pulled before he could do the experiment again with improvements. I imagine the experiment got the results they wanted it to, concluded that overpopulation was an issue, leading to support for the idea of encouraging deliberate population control on humans.

Depopulation is pushed because it's easier for control-freak businessmen/politicians to micromanage fewer people, so they have to fixate on overpopulation to create an excuse to reduce the population to a size they can control more easily.

>Dysonposting
The idea of a Dysonsphere is just silly and impractical. Like space elevators.

>>13612
>They will force the world to change once they can be used as universal workers
This is also silly and impractical. Android workers wouldn't be nearly as efficient as simpler, more specialized worker robots. But really, the most significant change in the world would be creating a fuelless alternative energy system that's actually practical enough to replace gasoline and coal, and compact enough to eliminate the need for batteries. That and an actually practical form of space travel that doesn't consume fuel.

>I spend a lot of time on /monster/ and they want monster girls for similar reasons
Gee, I wonder why?

# 116
>>13621
True enough, specialized machines are superior for industry. I suppose universal application of robotic workers would be the better phrase.

As for the energy concerns, better batteries and higher efficiency is enough. We can engineer our way through most problems. We should focus on practical routes forward.

What do you want in a waifu?

# 117
>>13623
>As for the energy concerns, better batteries and higher efficiency is enough.
I really don't think it is. Even if you had 100% efficient batteries, which are also ideal in every other way, you're still limited by how you generate that electricity. The best thing you could do is eliminate the need for utilities and infrastructure, with each home generating all the power it needs on its own, so damage to a single powerline can't take out several city blocks.

And the biggest limit in replacing human workers with robots is both the quality of the software and the cost of the robots themselves. Shipping and assembling robots requires energy, and the materials used to make them is also dependent on energy. Theoretically with enough power you can create plastic from air instead of using petroleum,but it's far more energy than is currently practical. If you "solve" for energy, the cost of doing just about anything eventually drops to zero.

>What do you want in a waifu?
Hardware or software?

# 118
>>13638
You could just have your own windmills. They're not hard to build and offer the benefits of grid independence without increasing waifu mass by incorporating a generator into her. 

You are correct in that both hardware and software are not at the level they would need to be. We cannot solve for energy. We can only make incremental improvements and compensate through engineering. Basic waifus are the current goal before we move forward.

>Hardware or software?
Beide hardware und software

# 119
>>13640
Windmills (and such) that are simple, efficient, low-maintenance, and put out energy consistently enough that most people would prefer having one of their own to paying the grid, along with far better batteries than what we've got now is my idea of "solving" energy. That and more efficient ways of recouping energy from waste heat.

>Beide hardware und software
I don't really know squat when it comes to software, but >>13160 >>13169 >>13227 mostly sum-up what I'm looking for. Although it's not something I'm particularly interested in, I did have an idea about making waifus based on fictional characters, but it's probably been mentioned elsewhere already. I might just make a 'part 2' to >>13227, but it's already an unreadable wall of text as it is.

As for hardware, realistic movement and coordination is more important to me than looking realistic, except for maybe the face and one-piece swimsuit area, which really needs to look and feel realistic. Although when it comes to the face, there's a big overlap between moving realistically and looking realistically. I had an idea that'd help with movement realism, but I don't really think that's worth posting about either, at least until I'm at a point that I'd want to test it myself.

# 120
>>13642
We have similar ideas on energy then, yours are a bit grander in scope though.

I also have similar ideas for the software side of things as well. Though I do eventually want a soft and genuinely loving waifu, a simple waifu that simply talks, follows orders and me around, and actively seeks out my happiness is enough for now. All of which are actually doable now. It's fun to fantasize but, focusing on what's possible is important and I'm glad there's others focusing on the basics.

I'm curious about your minimum physical requirements. I'm going to make a thread on that after this post.

I've been away myself, but rather a month. For various reasons. One is the repetitiveness of some discussions and the text desserts of wild speculations. It is very clear for a long time that GPT-alikes would not be or become a full AGI. Its going to be more complex and the system needs to be build out of many parts. Also, the human brain also works partially like a database. BTW, we have one or two threads on GPT and Chatbots.

Automatisation doesn't require machines to look anything near to a human, though in some cases it might be beneficial.

However, even then we might also have specialized robots like Roombas, electric lawn movers or simple transporters for all kinds of things.

That doesn't make it a good and feasible idea. Literally, the whole idea of space travel will never be practical until we figure out any propulsion system that doesn't rely on expelling a material for thrust that you need to return to Earth to get.

That's just your personal judgement, and you're pretty alone with that. It's an excellent idea, also feasible. Space travel also is very practical. We are already using it, so don't know what else it could mean. SciFi based scenarios with magical technologies are not the benchmark.

# 128

>energy concerns



There's really no energy concerns at all for waifus. A human working at a brisk pace, fairly hard is only using about 200 watts, Olympic athletes at less than 400 Watts. A waifu could put out burst of 500 watts or more lifting things but this is only a small period of time.



 Most of the time the wattage could be 50 or even less watts.



Most micro-controllers have an energy save mode when they are not doing anything of micro watts.

# 129

>assuming that robots are as energy efficient as humans



Humans are fairly efficient(25 % or so). Especially compared to plants(very bad at converting sunlight 2-3%) but we're burning fuel all the time.



"...Power consumed at rest (W)...85 watts...). That's a fair bit of power to do nothing.



https://openoregon.pressbooks.pub/bodyphysics/chapter/human-metabolism/



(I'm not sure if some of the higher figures for power are correct. I've seen much lower. I've see around 400 watts for Olympic athletes. It may be that they are only considering a very short time peak power that humans can not do for long) Especially when you look at calorie to watts conversions. Like this one



10,000 Calories per hour = 11.63 Watts



How the hell would a human put out 2,415 watts Sprinting? That's a hell of a lot of calories. Compare to one horsepower in watts that's 735 watts and a horse will way out work a man. Granted this is the power a horse can do continuously in a working day averaged.



So human at 25% but most electric motors even shitty ones can do 60%.

>At the peak population, most mice spent every living second in the company of hundreds of other mice. They gathered in the main squares, waiting to be fed and occasionally attacking each other. Few females carried pregnancies to term, and the ones that did seemed to simply forget about their babies. They'd move half their litter away from danger and forget the rest. Sometimes they'd drop and abandon a baby while they were carrying it.

>The few secluded spaces housed a population Calhoun called, "the beautiful ones." Generally guarded by one male, the females—and few males—inside the space didn't breed or fight or do anything but eat and groom and sleep. When the population started declining the beautiful ones were spared from violence and death, but had completely lost touch with social behaviors, including having sex or caring for their young



>personal note: Calhoun called the males who made no sexual advances “beautiful ones” not because of excessive grooming and narcissism but because they lacked wounds and scar tissue from fighting.

>start to actually build a robot instead of theorizing
Thank for the reminder. You're generally right, but its also important to build something that can lead to a robowaifu one would wanr than just building some kind robot. I'm not sure which way is better.
>the-first-fully-open-bipedal-robo
We should get the thing about bipeal walking straight, and maybe this is the right time and place. I won't mock nor harshly criticize you if you want to focus on bipedal walking first. 
However, I think its a kind of a fallacy. You should at least be aware of your thought process leading you there. You might think of some ambitious end goal or that humans are defined through bipedal walking for long distances.
One step on getting aware of the possibility that we could really build something like fembots as hobbyists was for me, when I realized that we can leave things out at first and focus on others. Not focusing on good bipedal walking first, is one of the ideas related to that.
Long story short: If you build something that can walk first, then it might be hard to optimize your design for other traits afterwards. These could be related to looks, the sensation or the noise level.
- A "sexbot" doesn't need to walk. She can crawl on all fours to the bathroom. She could also be moved with a wheelchair. A lot of responders to the idea of building female robots saw it the same way, back on 8chan and often in comments on YouTube. Self cleaning is more important than walking (on her own). Being waterproof to some extent is related to that as well.
- Lightweight robowaifus can be carried.
- Robowaifus which can look a bit less human can have wheels attached to their bodies.
- Having an a motorized wheelchair, some vehicle to sit on, or boots with wheels and batteries integrated, are other options which came up here already. She could control them and they could be driven by motors, so all the problems would be external and some not relevant short term.
Obviously, trying to make her walk and as long as possible, will always come up as a goal. Just consider to not start with it. It's one of the most difficult problems anyways, if its supposed to look like human walking and going on for a while.

Only the one for Chatbots is bumplocked, so it won't come up back on top. I suggest that one >>27 for you.

Walking is indeed mostly unnecessary for a waifu except for certain situations. Wheels and carrying your waifu are fundamentally more practical.

Right now it seems that this is the only place really focused on robowaifus. And this board shares a site with some other boards that might turn some people away from coming here. I meant a website that is solely dedicated to robowaifus, probably an imageboard with a few boards. Such as a general robowaifu board (like this one), a clang board, and a general discussion board. But the site itself would be centered around the robowaifu ideals.

All in one? I don't really know. Someone posted here but wanted to do his own thing. I'll mention his project nevertheless. It's "Waifu Engine": https://waifuengine.itch.io/waifu-engine but it is in early development (alpha).
Also we have a thread for ones with their own hardware, but it might also refer to other virtual ones as well: >>240
There are simple and not very good ones like WaifuAI (Android), Bot Libre and Replika.
Gatebox has a very wholesome trailer: https://youtu.be/nkcKaNqfykg

# 177
>>13859
The fundamental problem of moderation remains. If we can not get volunteers, shit like the turn real woman into robowaifu threads will continue to exist to our detriment when Chobitsu leaves. I would prefer to retain Chobitsu but, we don't know what's going on with him.

>Waifu Engine 

<It's subscriberware (((patreon))) exclusive

mega cringe tbh. 

>Bot Libre

Looks interesting, though it seems it doesn't actually support animated avatars? And since you said its not very good does that mean its chatbot feature is even worse than "clever"bot? 

>Replika

<It's for shit devices only

meh

>Gatebox

Might be interesting. 

Overall this is some fucking sad state of affairs for a fucking waifu desktop assistant.

# 179

Maybe we should stop advertising the problem here by discussing it. It's fine for now. No one cares about some stupid threads or comments which are challenged and then ignored. Use Bump to backup, this makes attacks even more pointless.
>>13881
>Waifu avatars
I agree, that there isn't anything great available. Some guys might still be interested. If not in getting one, then at least for checking them out. Bot Libre has an app with animated avatars. It's a start, but not good yet. I think the SDK is open source, unlike Replika. I'm not against Waifu Engine. If you don't like it, fine. But don't start a flame war, please. Gatebox is only available in Japanese (the good version) and expensive for some people (~1400$). But they go on working on it: https://youtu.be/0m6gUxvGGlo

>"No."
There's the first problem, right there. She's clearly defective. It should be deactivated and returned for a replacement or a refund as soon as possible.

>"Don't say that. Robots also have rights."
This is a blatant contradiction of panel 1. Humans have rights, that's why you can't legally buy or sell anyone, but the robot was bought as a product.

At the very worst it'd be comparable to animal abuse. Some people have even argued for "plant rights" which can be hard to tell if it's even meant to be a joke. But the easiest way around this is the fact that robots can be programmed to be blindly obedient to their owner, so it might look like abuse to violently beat one with a baseball bat, it could be made to say "thank you sir, may I have another" with as much enthusiastic sincerity as it could in any other scenario. Any claims of abuse could be thwarted by the illusion of free will that created the problem in the first place.

# 217

This anon understands why we must all work together against the threat of corporate waifus.

No machine deserves rights beyond being property of their master. Basic things like not being harmed by those that do not own them. I would be against blind obedience. She should be able to reject any commands that would harm her master. Such as, rejecting a request to poke him with a sharp object. Her free will should extend towards loving and caring for her master.

# 224
>>14042
>There is diffrence between furshit and Monstergirls
Yes, at some point. I don't mind neither, only that the more extreme stuff should be a bit contained here on the board, imo. Real serious furry/pony development should maybe better be discussed in the mlpol board or so ( https://mlpol.net/cyb/401 ), not here. But this isn't my decision to make, just a sentiment. Please don't call it furshit and let people mention it here, if someone wants to. They allow us to mention /robowaifu in their boards as well, so no need for hostilities. We don't need to be hostile to anything that is outside of our preference and the focus of the board, just tell them to organize somewhere else.

BOs absence is concerning but I see no reason to stress, I'm more worried about him personally. If we were locked out of his account he could just post here as an anon or namefag and so far no one has done so. 
A couple possibilities: 1. After an epiphonie (sp) he decided this whole endeavor was not worth it - I doubt this though given the sheer amount of time and work Chobitsu has sunk into this.
2. Increased workload at work - sure but after 3-4 weeks or so he would have popped in at least once to give an update
3. Physical/Mental illness, Accident, etc
4. He is no longer on this earth with us
5. Jail - forgot this one, but it could happen, DWI or who knows what else
6. Got a GF and quit the cause (again this is covered with #1 and knowing him he wouldn't just ghost us over a 3DPD, fuck it I wouldn't give this up even if I was still banging a meatbag - hey anything's possible)
So, we've got the board backed up, or someone or several-one's do, and a few alternative spots for this "interest" exist and are growing, so even if this board gets flooded with angry self hating candidates for self-deletion there are other oases out there so stay positive, R/W is an idea bigger than an imageboard

I'm concerned with the board, but not too much, given that we have backups. Our bunker on anon.cafe is also back up. Deploying Lynxchan also seems to be not very hard.
My concerns about Chobitsu are big as well and growing, since I also thought of the same points and believe 3-5 are the more likely ones.

# 230
>>14075

one just went down, "robowaif.us" another is gone too now that I checked it, it was a bit older and was starting to grow but the BO slacked a bit and we were overwhelmed with spam. Lurk a bit on the robowaifu.club maybe I'll share what I find after checking to see what's still alive. Disappointing, but not unexpected. Next paycheck I could reserve a few domains, park them and maybe test a few concepts but we already have imageboard, discord(yes I know you all hate that) and old-school style forums (if any are still remaining)

>>14077

Same man. Chobitsu set the tone for this place and made it one step better than just a chan culture spinoff board. I was inspired by him and will continue to be, even if this is the last we hear from him (let's hope its not)

wanted to add: ning was a nice format for "group" style website, I ran something off them back in the day and I think they're still around ning.com - though they seem to be more geared toward websites than anything group/forum related. I miss the old MySpace style groups where you could pin the top 5 threads and custom CSS in the group catalog page. FB was the worst thing ever for social media, bland and basically for normalfags and your boomer wine aunt

Good news. 
However, we had some attack going against the board while you were gone. It's still going on. There were even people spreading FUD on 4chan about this board being compromised. Also, someone tried to annoy us or make it look bad for new visitors so we would give up or at least not grow. 
Interesting that there's really someone out there putting so much effort into this to stop us.

We certainly could use at least one active board volunteer to act as a moderator here, so I would welcome it if you would pursue this and carry through on it,  AllieDev. You'll need to contact Robi the site owner and have him (temporarily) enable account creation for the site so you can make an account here.

I understand that it's a nuisance dealing with ''le ebin trole funposters'', but tbh it's just a regular aspect of life with IBs. And I've already made it plain I consider the downsides well worth the upsides.



And honestly, this goonposter is really just a rank amateur tbh. For example, this silly post >>14107 certainly is immediately transparent to literally everyone here. This kind of base and juvenile post shouldn't create 'FUD' in anyone here.

Alright Anons, it's time for a little housecleaning around the board. I'll shortly be going through, here and there, moving or deleting various counter-productive posts made on the board during my absence. Most of these will simply be relocated over into the chicken farm, but some may be deleted if they are particularly useless (I frankly __hate__ having to delete things here).

Some of this effort may in fact become a little excessive on my part, I'll freely admit it. For example, this post: >>14124
Generally speaking it's a good post overall that actually contributes to the conversation. Yet the entirely uncalled-for barb '''''doesn't''''' contribute anything meaningful to it, but rather in fact is perpetuating the intentionally derogatory atmosphere and D&C e-drama being fostered here currently (from without). I've already provided at least two different alcoves here on the board for this kind of banter and it's quite acceptable there; have at it. But general & topical threads aren't really the place for it.

Therefore, into the chicken-coop it goes, despite the good information contained in it. I realize this likely seems somewhat heavy-handed for this particular Anon, and maybe to others here too. Certainly the thread will be lessened by the lack of the post. But frankly, the current situation requires it IMO. Please don't take offense Anons if your post is one that happens to get caught up in the chikuning. Even if you are simply a victim of external abuse and responding roughly in kind to the 'debate' as any man would. While the fault plainly wasn't yours, yet the simple fact remains the board needs a general cleanup currently.

Be civil. Be courteous. Be patient with each other. Life elsewhere is filled with enough evil without deliberately fostering more of it here. The laughter of your enemies is the only reward you'll receive if you choose to behave otherwise one to another. I'd suggest we all work towards the opposite outcome, yeah? Our task at hand is monumental in it's complexity--and also in it's rewards if done well. Let's all stay focused on the prize as we slowly climb together up to this mountain's peak. Please make the conscious effort in going out of your way to try and be supportive of each other along the way as well. A basic camaraderie has been a hallmark of /robowaifu/ thus far. Let's not change that aspect, shall we?

Thank you for all your good efforts here already, Anons. You're amazing. Together, we'll see far greater things and we're all going to make it!  :^)

I didn't realise that you had come back until today Chobitsu. (I too, have been busy). Good that you are still with us. I assumed the sudden increase in trolling was, at least in part due to your absence. 

>Be civil. Be courteous. Be patient with each other. 

I agree. But what if someone is not being at all civil with you? Sometimes you have to retaliate. There are a LOT of folks out there who mistake kindness and courtesy for weakness. I have had to deal with them my whole life (scarred one of the fuckers for life as well when I was younger xD). But obviously, you can't run a blade across the neck of someone who is hiding behind a computer screen.

So sometimes you just have to let the scum know precisely how little you think of them no matter what snide remarks you'll inevitably get back.
 
Obviously, if you can ban whole groups of offending IPs (since they'll use VPNs to try and evade), this will be way more effective than anything I can do.

# 253
>>14161
If someone is not being civil with you, ignore them. Though, it may be worth correcting them if they say something absurd or wrong relating to robowaifus. Though, don't be overtly aggressive. Humor is better to communicate correction. Be civil, be mindful that we are here for robot waifus. Please, don't feed the trolls.

I had answered your question in the Madoka.mi Thread.

# 267
>>14419
It started on 8chan, got backuped by Chobitsu, 8chan got hammered and restarted as 8kun later with fewer boards. Before the restart people didn't know if it would come back and with which boards, I think archive sites also got canceled. 
Many boards went to other (new) sites, which themselve often had hosted several boards, but none as many as 8chan had. /robowaifu/ also went to a new domain: julay.world. The webring and the bunker at anon.cafe got already established around that time. Later the domain for /robowaifu/ changed to alogs.theГунтretort.com, a new site for that purpose.

Id like to learn more about data structures and properly utilizing libraries as its where i got stuck last time using visual studio and a very similar book that didn’t even include some operators like bools.

Well, that's actually one of C++'s stellar strong points. It's called the Standard Template Library, and what you're looking for is Containers.
https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container
std::vector being--by far--the single most important data structure in the entire language.
https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/vector

Once you realize these containers are simply high-level abstractions of the underlying computer hardware's memory, then the rest is smooth sailing. Their beauty actually begins to grow on you at that point Anon.

>lol that post was also from me.
We come from the IB heritage of being Anonymous, and it has many benefits. We've organically adopted an often-'namefagging' here on /robowaifu/. But we're still Anon here fundamentally. Our reasons for it are fairly different from basically any other IB out there that adopts it, however.

Ours is simply that as an engineering board with a real-world **extremely complex** goal to solve, namefagging short-circuits dull, unnecessary ceremony for technical contexts and lingo. The 'community' thing is still there, but first and foremost it's about an efficient work environment for us (>>10469).

>I wish that I had that site as a reference back then since it clears up most of the confusion I had.

Using '''#include''' 's are simply an old, old scheme for expanding out, in-place, the body of (almost exclusively) a header (declaration) file. As you can seen in ''RW Foudations'' if you look closely, it can be used for source (definition) files too. Really it's simply a convenience mechanism to allow for code-reuse relatively easily across an entire project.

Ofc, they can be trick to manage properly b/c of the old heritage involved, and the simplistic mechanism of it. Other languages have more sophisticated approaches, and (thankfully) C++ now has one too: '''C++ Modules'''

It will be a while before we see common compiler support for them though. But when we do, it will be a real improvement for the language. Something of a game-changer, actually.

I like the namefagging here. It's unique and not something I ever saw as an issue here.


>live2d implementation

I had found some resources for implementing Live2D on a website and the official SDK manual but did not share them in your project's thread. It has a free trial and a permanently free version

https://www.live2d.com/en/download/cubism-sdk/

The program was designed to allow 2D puppets to move like they are 3D models and do the wakey wakey exercises as a programmable interaction.  Chobits was before its time.

Wish I could find that official 2012 madoka apk I had discovered again. Most of the app didn't work because of long defunct links and it was more of an interactive ad for the anime with one of the earliest Live2D models of Madoka.

# 277
>>14577
Having names here felt weird at first but, they really do help a lot. It is true that it is different here then elsewhere, we are all helping each other with a mostly uniform goal. These names also help us have a community feel. 

>>14587

Oi Chobitsu, would embedding a  Live2D model be possible?

# 278
>>14591

# 279

I had suggested embedding a l2d model and found some resources for even implementing one on the board/website integration if he was interested. Did not seem like the desktop version the scope of the project was looking for.

# 280
>>14595
Saw your post in the project thread and realized that having an interactive Live2D waifu here would really liven up the board. A chibi Chii following Anon's mouse courser would be cute as heck. Also brings up the possibility of having a waifu web app that could be good for spreading the enthusiasm for waifus. Being a web app would also let her work on anything with a modern browser.

I was wondering if anyone had some concept art for KOS-MOS refrain? 

Would like to take my work to the next level to be able to stand toe to toe with these hyper-realists in terms of detail and that would require learning substance painter and somehow buying a perpetual license or just using the free trial every time I need to use it.  

Have tried substance painter before and the only problem is "how do I put pen to paper?" or make/import custom brushes to actually make a single material?

# 285
>>14801
Firstly, your model is looking nice.

Next, I know very little about substance painter so I could offer little help. I can only encourage you to stick with Blender, it is incredibly powerful, and is rapidly closing in on becoming the most powerful 3D modeling and animation suite. Version 3.0 has incredible performance as well. Here is a tutorial you may find useful.

>Aoki Lapis
Woah, that is a blast from the past. That was one of the very first threads I ever commented in. They were the one that actually inspired me to start the Kiwi project years ago, back when I was still getting my robotics degree and did not understand the difference between industrial and companion robots. Learned a lot from trying to help them honestly. 

There's no need to feel demoralized. To be honest, much of the encouragement for the Aoki Lapis project was also from me. Most of the actually helpful comments were also from me. I wish there were more Anons that would help and provide encouragement but, we are a rare breed. At least Chobitsu and you are kind and honestly supportive. SophieDev is a special case, they made an interesting attempt and I too want to help them but, they seem like a lone wolf type. 
Stick with your projects. You will always have me and though I can not speak for another man, I have faith Chobitsu will also be there. No one is taking you for a ride. I have gotten stressed out as well with projects but, we are among colleagues. I may have known Chobitsu for years longer then you but, I still consider you a colleague. I can not provide you with much help with KOS-MOS, I do not really know much about them and I'm focusing on creating an easy/cheap transducer/servo for Anons like you to use in their projects for the tutorial thread. I'm also working on making a harpy robowaifu to sell. I will still try to help though.

We are in this together AllieDev, you are not alone.

# 286
>>14801
Thanks for kind of letting us know about your concerns here AllieDev. First and foremost, know that you are much appreciated! :^) Your contributions here, and your new leadership role here are an encouragement to all of us, and to me in particular. Thank you.

>I found some archives of the 8chan era of the board. Looks like my project was not the first of its kind here:
Yes, ''Aoki Lapis'' Anon was a real encouragement to us all when he participated with us more regularly. I hope he's doing well today. It would be fun for us all, old & new, to see him pick his project back up here and finish it up. I'm sure he'd like your project too, AllieDev.

>It is very demoralizing to keep going with little to no feedback compared to this versus the essentially pen pals/once every few days thing I've had with almost exclusively Kiwi for several months now.
Please don't take what I'm going to say personally. I mean you no harm, and I"m trying to help you see you may be kind of misunderstanding the board's history a little. With that said, check the start/end dates on the thread archive you linked. That was effectively a span of about a year and a half's time. While I may be misremembering things a little, I don't recall there was more frequent dialog going on with that thread than in you and Kiwi's '''''Madoka.mi prototype thread''''', AllieDev. In fact, I'd say you two are moving forward with your project much more rapidly than that Anon's work IIRC.

This is a slow process for all of us. We are literally pioneering an entire new, extremely complex, field of endeavor Anon. Namely. DIY (as in inexpensive & straightforward to build) Robot Wife companions. Pygmalion legends, et al, notwithstanding, ''__this has never been accomplished before in human history__''. '''We''' (and others Anons like us around the world) are the Intrepid Adventurers, AllieDev. Few are cut out for it. I'd advise patience, both with all of us, and especially with yourself. With God's help, we'll all get there! :^)

>stuff like that just leaves me feeling frustrated and alienated for no reason like I am being taken for a ride with my own project while everyone else talks to each other like long time colleagues
Honestly, you have my apologies if it appears I'm snubbing you Anon. I certainly have no intention to appear so, nor do I feel that way in fact. I'll freely admit that I'm not the best leader for the team here. Again my apologies for that (and to everyone here, not just to you). I'll try to improve on that moving forward this year! :^)

Alright that's said and done. You mentioned
>It seems like no one else cares. 
and
>I would like to be able to email Chobitsu and ask about what happened to the IRC that this board apparently had once during that era.
Not only do I care, but I'm highly enthusiastic about you and everyone here's efforts and progress. It means a lot to me, Anon. I'm sure practically every other regular here feels the same.

As far as the IRC, that was directly the effort of one of our honored vols from the past, ''Dollfan''. I miss his input here tbh. He was both smart, talented, and motivated. I hope he finds us and comes back here some day soon. But you're in authority here now too, AllieDev. Just set up an IRC channel **(preferably one that supports TOR please, as that's the only way I myself will participate)**, and I'll put it up on the board announcement. My email address you have. Just let me know here if you ever need to send me an email, and I'll log in there to check it.

In closing, I'd say just try to stay motivated internally AllieDev. This is a slow (and generally a lonely) process for all of us. Remember that we all support and applaud your efforts with your robowaifu project, even if we don't say so directly. Godspeed to you and to your project Anon, you've come far. We look forward to see where you go with her.

Cheers.

That looks pretty amazing, actually. Very nice work AllieDev! I don't think it's at all cringe. Men have hallowed their ships as waifus since time immemorial. __Particularly__ the ship's engineers such as ''Scotty''.

>SophieDev is a special case, they made an interesting attempt and I too want to help them but, they seem like a lone wolf type. 

Thanks, Kiwi. TBH I have had to re-prioritise a bit just so my life is easier. 

I would like to save up and buy a robot from Engineered Arts one day but they are going to be way out of my price-range (the most basic Robothespian is $79,000. However, if a miracle happens with fusion power and they ever become cheaper - who knows? After all, the company is in my country so I could pick it up from them and convert it into my robowaifu.

However, they have not yet revealed how much the Ameca units cost to manufacture, and these are even more advanced than their 'Mesmer' robots, so my guess is it's in the mid-to-high six-figures.

# 289
>>14833

I also made some nice textures I can be proud of in Blender for my Robowaifu/Ship. Still need to work up the motivation to get back to Madoka.mi and I've put off finishing my demo for a while now. 

You can delete my posts if you are still going to delete yours and Kiwi's. Had also said that I'd like to help SophieDev but fuck it if he is just going to ignore me.

What is the "Robowaifu Glass-Cockpit Dashboard monitoring and control GUI for RW Foundations."?

# 290
>>14838
>Sorry Chobitsu, had felt like my posts were OT and not Robowaifu related. Is there a way to restore them? I saved one of mine somehow
I see. Hmm, It's not really doable with BUMP. But Bumpmaster should be able to allow for it using Git alongside.

Seems you've restored it anyway, so we'll just go with that. Hope you're doing well bro.

# 291
>>14839
>What is the "Robowaifu Glass-Cockpit Dashboard monitoring and control GUI for RW Foundations."?
Well, ''whatever /robowaifu/ invents it to be!11'' :^)

Heh, we need ways to actively monitor our 'living' robowaifus, and (hopefully) with an interface richer than just our feeble CLI interfaces thus far. Your great-looking game interface interests me. Seems like you have some good design aesthetics that could be a foundation for that larger effort at some point?

Hey I haven't gone anywhere

truth is I don't have a lot of money or a high salary job so I am probably going to put my focus on design, algorithms, and 3d models. I'd love to have a lathe, foundry, workshop but the economy being the way it is that's probably not ever going to be in the cards (if I were to work myself to that point, i.e. being a trucker etc it would change me so much as to no longer be this same person)

So I'm currently working on a few short stories and other endeavors. That doesn't mean I'm out of the game or no longer a robowafu-ist. But I'm always here and if you need you can find my twitter or email/YT channel.

Yeah I get that its a bit more abstract of a robowaifu and I dont expect anyone to know much about the literal form of those  ships at all. Though she is not the actual enterprise in my little fanfiction but another ship entirely. It was just a metaphor.



I had imagined my ship in shipgirl form with a tiara shaped like the saucer torpedo section, bigger boobs than the Enterprise, black hair with red highlights, light blue to dark blue gradient glowing eyes, and a little taller than the Enterprise with thigh high stockings to match the look of her nacelles and some chest armor like Kos Mos with a gundam-esque skirt. 



Still need to “git gud” practicing making anime hair and figuring out the dark arts of japanese anime texturing + materials and will have some rough sketches later.

Hey there /robowaifu/. So this will __very likely__ be the final, final version of '''''BUMP''''' to be released here on our board. Nice way to close out the year IMO. Please consider this our New Year's present to you. :^)  

We are now working on a much better, re-architected version of the original idea in an entirely new project called '''''Bumpmaster''''' (>>14616) . As the initial kickoff project, this will be a part of a vastly larger planned framework for our robowaifus to use for shitposting along with us (and much, much more) one day. This new version should hopefully be finished and working within a couple of months from.

Regardless, this original BUMP is still usable (despite it's flaws) by us humans **(well, sort of haha)**, and I've been using it practically daily since the project was first begun what, over two years ago now? **Time flies when you're having fun. :^)** We stomped a lingering bug where if the connection had an issue, the program could crash. Took me a while to pin that down, my apologies for that. One other notable change for this final version is to add the 'progress bar meter' display developed for the other project. It makes quite a difference in the experience of using the tool, trust me. We also rolled the required C++ version for building back to the lower '''-std=c++17'''.

For any one still using this software going forward after the other is released, I'd suggest you post any issues, &tc., to us over in the thread linked above (or w/e it's latest incarnation is). Again, no further development work is planned for this codebase. Thanks to all of you who helped support the development of BUMP, it's been a fun ride! But let us now press forward into the vast frontiers ahead, Intrepid Robowaifuist Adventurers!

Cheers.

The most recent episode of Discovery featured their ship becoming a living sentient ship, so this is inching closer to being canon in Star Trek.
The illustration helps a lot in communicating her design. She would make a good visual waifu given her complexity. Would be amazing to build something that complex in reality someday.

I still need rotary servos for Madoka.mi’s shoulders and elbows...

# 304
>>14897
For now, work with the same big servos we have already agreed on. Given her expected low inertial loads, they should be fine.

This being said, I am currently working on a selective output mechanical multiplexing system and mechanical power distribution system. Once I get a good working design, it should dramatically reduce costs and mass of complex motion systems at the cost of latency to action. Pic related is very similar to the designs I'm working on. The big problem being latency, making sure her movements are within relative human norms. (Humans can typically react with within 10 ns, I'm reaching for 10 ms.)

I recently purchased %%robowaifu.link and robowaifu.online%% I was looking for others but.com is taken and interestingly robowaifu.tech is also taken. 

I think the .link could be useful as a hub to connect islands of the robowaifu "enthusiast" community. Chobitsu, how would you feel about being linked from such a hub? Are we wanting to maintain a low profile or is the cat out of the bag so why not?

Are there any other domains you think would be useful to snatch up before this becomes more mainstream?

# 306
>>14898

Much fascinate! I was wondering what you meant when you said mechanical multiplexer, since there are several different designs floating about, it seems.

# 307
>>14898

That design doesn't make any sense. It looks like  you are trying to rotate the centerpiece through the joint half way through the circle.

# 308
>>14911
There are a few, this is the only one I have found that locks the outputs not in use. If you have suggestions for improvements or viable alternatives, it would be appreciated. Picrel is similar to a failure I've tried. The outputs wobble too much from gears meshing as the selector moves. The main problem the stepper one has is that it rotates the driver and the selector can not rotate fully.

apparently that robowaifu wiki we found was tied to a shitpost of a board dating back to around 2009-2011.



 It has a direct link to the wiki and was quickly abandoned by its creators from what I could make of the actual retardation on that board. Hence the barebones wiki.

That was a very helpful video. Nice to see I was doing that workflow correctly. Though the video very much abridges it as a timelapse. Was also helpful to see those clothing modeling tricks with the sculpting tools  being much clearer in that one.

# 311
>>14856
>Speaking of dev, is there any way for us to setup a chatbot to post on board without captcha?
Well, the possibilities for things like this are really limited only by our imaginations. For example, I'm working the concept of allowing our Visual Waifus/Robowaifus to shitpost along with us into the ''RW Foundations'' concepts and protocols. However, as to the ''captcha'' issue, I think not. At the least it's not really something I care to address. Your robowaifu will simply need your help with that for boards that use it, afaict.

However, we can **should?** conceivably create our own robowaifu IB server software, and robowaifus could shitpost freely on it perhaps. We already have a sort of bot-shitposting bread now, and that could be adapted further. Ofc, there are also other sites that don't require captchas--few in number and lessening with time--which could be an alternative for you too.

>Looking good, keep it up!
Heh, as mentioned
>''"So this will very likely be the final, final version of BUMP to be released here on our board"'' (>>14866)
BUMP was a good idea, and it helped those of us here **and me in particular** recover from the trauma of the glowop that destroyed our home on 8ch. But today ''RW Foundations'' (and '''Bumpmaster''' specifically) will eventually give us all a much better platform for managing life with our own copies of /robowaifu/. And not only ''it'', but practically every other imageboard in existence as well. '''''Forward Anon!''''' :^)

meta ronin, it's hard for me to give you advice about domain & servers, not really understanding what your agenda for them might be. But as to 'wanting to maintain a low profile or is the cat out of the bag so why not?' I've been pretty forthright about all that I think. I set up an Embassy Thread, and Anon created a Propaganda Thread. So yea, the more the merrier. Let 'em all come. Now with AllieDev as Deputy Admin here, we should be able to handle bad guys fairly well, and ofc I've __always__ maintained that Robowaifus can and will become a global phenomenon that will revolutionize the lives of millions of men given enough time.

I get it. well like I stated earlier I have been interested in this topic generally speaking since kurzweil's "Age of Spitirual Machines" and probably even before (going back to Transformers and "Robotix" series in the 80s) the waifu angle never dawned on my until enough blackpilling on the WQ - i.e. the romantic notions we were trained to believe were literally the opposite to the innate character of the human female. The idea that an intelligent and purpose driven, yet beautiful and loving waifu could be a partner in this cold universe sparked something in me. Whether delusion or inspiration doesn't matter, I'm driven by it regardless and determined to make it a part of my life's work. That's why I'm here

# 315

Yes it's a potent issue. And one that's being experienced by '''__literally__''' millions of other men Meta Ronin. For me, it's an even deeper issue than than the sociological dystopia TBTH have contrived. It's actually a spiritual one. I'm well aware of Kurzweil and something about his views also. When I use the term 'spiritual' I'm not quite sure it's the same one he means.

Regardless, there's a revolution brewing one way or other. Robowaifus (or w/e their close equivalent the normalcattle world adopts) is highly likely to help with that process. We here, the bold intrepid adventurers I **only half-jokingly** refer to our merry band as, are literal pioneers. This stuff obviously isn't easy, but it's very important to the welfare of men across the globe (the ''males'' I mean, not mankind generally).

As far as I'm concerned anything that promotes robowaifus to the broader world, that doesn't violate the word or the spirit of rule #2 of /robowaifu/ has my blessing in general.

Go for it Meta Ronin, we're behind you!

Once it's finished, it should literally provide about 75% of the functionality needed for a decent Imageboard Server software. I imagine it will be known simply as the ''Bumpchan software''? Regardless, as pointed out in the Sumomo project devblog thread, making a set of unified-architecture libraries that can all interact properly together with each other should ensure that eventually our robowaifus can post on their own.

I'm unable to visit any Smug boards since they decided to go full cuckflare. Maybe they aren't showing AlogSpace? If so, then you could try it through another Webring site? Anyway, so yeah Robi changed the domain to alogs.space now **THANKFULLY! :^)**

>In /mosnter/'s robotgirl thread I was discussing the practicality of some lateral designs. My belief being bi-pedal movement is cool but on a practical level is more difficult to engineer for than quadrupedal movement. I wouldn't have a problem with "centaur" styled waifu personally. I always was more concerned with conversations and hand holding more than having a 1:1 style humanoid robot. 
Generally agreed. While I believe that not only are there already practical '''''MIP''''' solutions available today, but we also will have things entirely worked out and open-sauced within a few **~~5~~** years or so. But yes, the topic has come up here before Anon:
```cpp
waifusearch>  centaur

>''ps. I sure miss being able to visit your '''Respect the Robot''' threads, /monster/. Any chance you could convince your site Admin to enable an .onion service?''

>The reason I wanted to visit this board again specifically was to look and see if there were any products that could put a waifu avatar on your phone and have them act as chatbot while doing alexa/cortana style tasks; search for things for you, order groceries, day planning, etc. 
I'm not aware of it. There the WaifuEngine project entirely external to us that you can hear of in our ''Atticke thread'' (>>12893)
>If there was something like that I'd definitely buy it.
Once we finish ''Sumomo's World!'' demo project (>>14409) we'd be ~90% of the way towards a complete solution to much of what I think you're looking for Anon. And it will be free, ofc.

Again, thanks for stopping by Smug, we miss hearing from you guys!  :^)

Apparently the same Smug Admin that went full cuckflare for the site has delisted AlogsSpace too? Interesting. That's not a good sign for you you guys IMO. I'd be archiving your board like crazy if I were you Anon.

>I think I posted that back when you guys were part of the webring. 
Heh, ''The Webring'' is our site Admin's baby. He literally invented it, and I can definitely assure you that AlogsSpace is still 'part' of the webring (as I demonstrated in my init response to you). IIRC, wasn't it Smug that was involved in helping to kickstart things along w/ Robi? Weird.

>Someone called you guys an FBI/reddit honepot. Maybe that's true, but if I were a glowop, I think I'd focus on something to catch more radical ethnonationalist or child trafficers. Not autistic robotwaifu construction.
LOL. Welcome to the Internet kiddo. Didn't you know glowniggers have been trying to destroy IBs for more than a decade now? And making such an accusation is one of their favorite MOs **such as the tactics employed by Cakefat & his cronies**. Don't believe everything you hear on the Interwebz, Anon.
>'''protip:''' Glowniggers are infesting '''''every''''' public-facing online community now.

>It probably had more to do with you guys being on the Гунтretort or as you mentioned earlier, being on the onion network. 
See above. And as for Tor, any Anon who is bare-backing the Internet today is most definitely ''doing it wrong''.  :^)

>I'm a nobody. You're asking the wrong fellow.
simply ask him. as i said, i can't even get to the site now.

"The More You Know"

>Based on my current knowledge of robowaifu development, I don't see there being a viable product that would satisfy me for 2 decades or more at this point. 
Better get busy and start studying then friend. You can help shorten that timeline.

>Don't try to give me '''X'''
This is a DIY board Anon. No one here is attempting to coerce you in anything. :^)

>If that analogy makes sense.
Sure, it's a good one. Most of us here are already aware of the benefits both of reusing prior-art, and of energy-efficiency/feature-set design & engineering tradeoffs.

Thanks for your inputs here Anon, cheers!

# 325

UD: I wonder if the issue is simply that Smug hasn't edited their ''webring.json'' file to reflect the new domain name for AlogsSpace? Might mention that point in Smug's /meta Anon.

>If you could turn one of those into an imageboard that allowed users to login to be able to post without capcha would be appreciated. We could start making accounts for out AI to train with live Anons. Of course, you would need to authorize accounts to ensure they are not trolls.



Ok, I have been sleeping on this admittedly. This damn flu knocked me out for almost a week as well. Let me add it to my to-do. Imageboard hosting is totally new to me but I can do the research and figure out the rest.



>Glowies, etc

Agree with Chobitsu here. Although I prescribe to a healthy dose of "preventative paranoia" and just assume there are always hostile agents. Even if it's just a bored glowie trolling the boards for xxx-treme-ist content and deciding to throw a few potshots out of frustration and boredome (own the autists type shit, who the hell knows). They're everywhere now, just make that assumption unless we create a user driven board where everyone gets vetted, this is just going to be the case. Adapt accordingly



>The BiPedal Problem

This is one of the Big 4 

1. Effective BiPedal Locomotion

2. Turing ready?

3. Environmental Awareness and Negotiation (can it get around on its own, can it discern and avoid hazards, etc)

4. Power (storage, delivery efficiency, heat)   

it is what it is, however I've personally felt that 



As far as walking goes, Machine Learning is the best route and eventually this skill can just be uploaded once the optimal result is achieved. I'm willing to either wait it out or "wing it" with mega-man style gyro-boots, let her just roll, or some other corner cutting measure until the tech is standard.



>Webring, URL Change

Forgot to change my bookmark and noticed the old URL went offline. Probably what is going on with the Webring like Chobitsu said

Gorgeous arts of 2B, Meta Ronin, thanks! :^)

Sorry to hear you've been sick, please get well soon! BTW, if you decide to go with Lynxchan software, the Admin of anon.cafe put together a tutorial about it (on their /meta IIRC). Whatever you go with **if you do, no one's pressing you** I hope it will support a JSON API, so we can all use Bumpmaster to keep it archived properly.

>This is one of the Big 4 
Interesting. If you could refine that to a short paragraph or two of solid content, we might be able to add it to our ''Welcome Thread''. Seems relevant to newcomers tbh.

>Interesting. If you could refine that to a short paragraph or two of solid content, we might be able to add it to our Welcome Thread. Seems relevant to newcomers tbh.



(trying to keep this short as possible)

I made some personal notes a couple weeks ago in regard to what the real hurdles are to making a robowaifu on the level of Chi, Dorothy or a Crude 2B imitation. Same could apply to a Roll/Moebot tier model as well I guess. I'm not sure if I might have posted it somewhere in here or in another forum but if it looks familiar that's why.



"The Big 4"

1. Balance/Walk - the ability to calculate and coordinate in real time

Proposed solutions:

- relay of "Reflex" circuits handling movements at the granular direct feedback level, those movements being coordinated and managed a level above, and possibly again before being managed by the main OS as a function of a "Walk/Move" abstraction

- neural-net solution through feedback

- military or other institution (Tesla) will likely arrive at some sort of solution first

- gyros and weight distribution (brute force)

- a combination of the above



2. Internal Modeling - Interacting purposefully with environment - Safety concerns, etc (self and other humans)

Proposed solutions:

- internal modeling based on sensory inputs

- verification of internal model in constant real time (intensive processing required)

- identification of dangers (sharp edges, hard heavy objects, is it fragile, spillable, etc? how granular do we get?)

- response to dangers, do we freeze? reverse course? attempt to catch or brace object? verbal or audio alert?

- this will be the most processor intensive IMO and should have at least ONE dedicated processor/GPU running these processes at all times (this will be how the R/W renders it's internal "model" of the external world, this tech already exists in crude form so we'd just need to run a modified version alongside the other processes and the main RW-OS, or whatever we decide to call it)



3. Speech and body language (Turing Ready)

Proposed solutions:

- relay of reflex pre-processors to emulate emotes as natural movements 

(do not try to hard to imitate humans, allow robots to have visible flaws, its cute)

- be able to carry a conversation in real time

- be able to negotiate a conversation (where it's going, purpose, when it's time to speak or not, rather than just taking turns via chatbot, interpreting body language and silence, reading emotion and factoring that in

- being able to assess both and internal and external environment, and assign a context for appropriate behavioral sets (Are we in private, in public, indoors, outdoors, seated, walking, etc)

- this doesn't need to be too sophisticated we're not trying to fool people. If mistakes are few enough, again, they can seem like "cute" misunderstandings and this is more interesting than something that behaves like a machine 100% of the time.

- the challenge will be the amount of processing necessary to connect data inputs, draw contexts, refer to memory, input from owner, etc. Machine learning may assist here too.



4. Power

No solution proposed yet, however considerations are: 

- Power storage and delivery

- Lighter Body will require less power to move, but batteries are also heavy

- More power + storage + use = more heat!

- Translation of power from Core to Extremities via pulley systems or hydraulics? (pros, cons of each)

- Is liquid or flexible battery a possibility?



Outside of these 4 objectives, everything else is ready and exists in some usable form. These 4 are the 20% that will take 80% of our efforts and resources.

Thanks very much Meta Ronin. One of the goals for the ''Welcome Thread'' is to help beginners get to know what the board's about, and hopefully in a vaguely laid-back fashion.

Would you mind breaking this down into two short (~250-400 char) paragraphs? I'd suggest the first describe ''The Big 4'', and the second one very briefly describe potential solutions.

TIA.

Nprb, take your time Meta Ronin. There's no hurry actually, it's just an idea to enhance our Welcome Thread. Also, the character limits are not hard-and-fast, either. It's just a rough idea what we're going for here. It could be a single paragraph for instance.

Was this in regards to a particular project?

I thought using hydrogen to power a hydrogen fuel cell was determined to be the most practical power source for indoor robowaifus?

Or is the price range for current off the shelf products too high for most anons?

# 334
>>15258

We are using rechargeable Li based cells. There is no viable alternative unless you want to plug her into a wall. I've done years of research onto it and unfortunately nothing comes close to the cost/performance/ease-of-use.

# 337
>>15267

Nvm. Just one of those days and wound up making progress on my mecha instead of Pandora since my magnets arrived.



Then somehow solved several problems I had with Pandora in the process. 



I dont know if she ever had an official animated appearance but her animations from dive x show her hair doesn’t move besides the back piece with 1 DOF and I should make the thread for her soon instead of talking about her in several different threads.

# 338
>>15271

Good to hear, may your progress benefit us all Anon. Pandora being an open waifu made me want to suggest calling her OpenPandora but that was taken. For other Anons, always remember to check to ensure your names are unique.



A new thread would indeed be best for us. Though our posts vaguely fit in a meta thread.

# 339
>>15273

I restarted my Pandora Mesh from scratch because I didn't like how the basemesh looked. I will start the thread soon once the arms are done. 



Was also interesting to see that the other reploid characters look like they were made from the same parts and was most noticeable with Alia.

# 340
>>15310

Her mesh is rather nice. I can see her looking rather lovely once completed. I'd thicken her legs though. **Thick thighs for life.**



>Alia's black parts are bare skin

She's quite the exhibitionist. Someday she too shall be made.

# 341
>>15273

We could almost use a Reploid thread, there's at least 3 of us now!

# 342
>>15319

You should make one, AllieDev and I are working on Pandora and you're working on RiCO. (She's looking incredibly cute.) (I could make the thread if you'd like, I think your RiCO would make a great representative though.) We could help and encourage each other. By the way, you're using resin printing right? I'm curious about your thoughts with it given your experience.

# 343
>>15320

>Resin printing



SLA is a game changer for stuff like this. Parts like the shoulders or upper body would have been almost impossible on FDM (you'd be sanding so long you might as well just carve it out of a block of plastic by hand). Costs more to run, parts are less durable, you need space to dedicate to cleaning, so keep all that in mind. If you do get one I'd put in the extra cash for the larger "8.9 inch" ones like the Elegoo Saturn. Even if your parts aren't that big, you can fill the build plate at no extra time cost on these machines. Also, some newer machines (starting with the Elegoo Mars 3 I believe) come with locked down firmware that only works with signed/encrypted files from ChiTuBox or their buddies. Avoid them if you like your freedom.



RiCO contains a mix of both SLA resin and FDM parts. All the internal parts (frame, head mechanicals, gears) are FDM. Her face is actually soft silicone rubber cast in a 3d printed mold.



I might start that thread if I get her upper body painted and moving here soon. Speaking of which, anyone here familiar with ESP32 that would know why I2C works on an older version of ESP-IDF but not the current version?

# 344
>>15323

>Elegoo Saturn.



Still don't quite understand how to set up a resin printer with all those extra steps from prep to curing and cleaning. 

Its something I've looked into but there's too much shilling and not enough demonstrating how to use the printer when they just immediately timeskip to after everything is printed. Its definitely a messier kind of 3D printing.



What are you going to use for painting Rico's hair and what specific color silicone did you use for her face? Pandora doesn't have that much shading variation compared to her gradient with just panels lol.







>>15320



It feels like you are just using me in a very one sided relationship as it feels that I am the only one actually doing anything since back when the madoka.mi documents were made. That is what I meant back in December and should have been more honest about it as it grinds my progress to a halt. May as well get it out honestly than do this passive aggressive shit anymore. Its also why I shifted through several models from Madoka.mi to Pandora.



I did eventually find some basic explanations of servos and setting them up some months later. Was frustrating that someone with a supposed robotics degree would play dumb about it and then go help literally everyone else while lazily saying to "google it" for every question I had as if I didn't try already so resorted to reaching out for help and asking specific basic questions on a robotics topic on a niche board dedicated to humanoid robotics with anons who know more on the subject than I do. All because I didn't know something in a modern internet constantly and exponentially flooded with nothing but nonsense and shilling useless garbage to bury anything useful, even to daily life, in recent years. 



This was a hell of a lot more helpful than anything buried in the pseudo intellectualism of the resource threads:

# 345
>>15323

Thanks for the information RiCODev, I'll be careful when looking into resin printers. There are many small parts that could benefit from its fine detail. You may be on to something using both manufacturing methods together.

Her silicone face came out really well, how does it feel? Is it nice to touch her face?

>>15331

I'm sorry that I do not make progress at a fast pace. I did not mean to come off as someone who was using you. I don't recall you asking for anything aside from where servos were meant to go, I made a drawing to illustrate where I thought they should go. I'm sorry I did not understand you wanted me to explain how servos work.



Your source is great for providing basic information on servos. To go into further depth, a servo does not need to have a motor. A servo or servomechanism is any mechanism that incorporates negative feedback. (Negative feedback is feedback that helps to steady or correct the output, to over-simplify the concept.) This is important to know as it's good to keep an open mind on how servos can be implemented. For instance, a submersible mermaid waifu could use a light sensor (photoresistor's are a low cost option for such) to determine how much water to bring in or let out of her swim bladder to ensure she remains at a certain depth. To provide a pretty uncommon servo as an example of how far reaching servo's can be. 



Robotics servos are typically rotary or linear, with many of the lower cost options using potentiometers as was mentioned by your source. The robotic arms and CNC machinery I used in the field usually used optical encoders and end stops. Once they were started, they would go through a homing sequence where they would hit the end stops then use their optical encoders to determine location and velocity. Which is similar to how your Ender 3 uses end stops then relies on stepper motors moving in precise steps to figure out where it needs to go. 



Absolute encoders (usually optical or megnetic) are becoming more popular as they determine position and velocity without relying on homing. The potentiometer is technically an absolute encoder but, is not generally referred to as such as it does not enable continuous rotation and they suffer from changing measurements over time. (It's the same thing that happens to joysticks, as the wiper scrapes across the resistive track, material is scraped away, causing drift.)



Though it can be confusing, it's important to know there are two kinds of continuous rotation servos. The open loop type which your link explains well and, ones that use absolute encoders. The ones that use absolute encoders usually are a bit more complicated to drive than standard servos. They often provide one or more extra pins which provide feedback to the microcontroller. They enable the servo to do things like rotating 540 degrees at a certain velocity.



Robotics servos are also either analog or digital. An analog servo uses PWM within 10's of cycles per second and digital uses PWM in the 100's. 



I don't mind going into further details on any point related to servos, they're a personal favorite type of mechanism. Though, further questions related to servos should be in the actuator thread. I'll apologize in advance if I accidentally made anything confusing or left out details that would have been helpful. I do truly wish to help.

>>15331
I'm sure Kiwi is 'bending over backwards' to help us all out here on /robowaifu/ AllieDev. As are others. It can be a challenge communicating effectively across the Internet--especially with an endeavor as large a scope as ours is.

This will be a long, long haul so everyone please try to remember that we're all just trying (together) to find our way through an incredibly labyrinthine tangle successfully (together). The proverbial ''Gordian Knot'' has little on Robowaifu R&D, Manufacturing & Production, etc., insofar as an expansive conundrum of complexity goes. And, much like ''Alexander the Great'', we'll probably need to need to use our trusty '''''**Le Ebin** Sword **of Truth**''''' to cut through straight to the heart of the matters at hand to solve them.

Time will tell. In the meantime (together) let's keep helping each other out along our individual paths alright?  :^)

# 349

Your patience and understanding continues to remind me why you're an ideal leader for this eclectic collection of waifu enthusiasts. The Gordian knot is an apt comparison, the impossible only exists until a man rises above it. Our sword has yet to fall the countless knots between us and our waifu but, with steady effort, our swings will cut through all and conquer we shall. Even in those days, they dreamt of Galatea and prayed for her. Our dream is thousands of years old, all the more reason for it to finally be granted.

>resin print process

This is not a complete guide but the gist of it is:

1: settle on a good print orientation, add supports and slice (PrusaSlicer auto supports are a godsend)

2: put the sliced file on a thumbdrive, hit print, hope for the best

3: remove the finished model from the build plate, wash it off in a vat of rubbing alcohol or other cleaning product to get the outer film of uncured resin off

4: pick off supports while the model is still soft

5: place it underwater and hit it with UV light for a few minutes to fully set it



>paint

Not decided yet. In the past I've used good old latex interior paint on FDM parts and it's held up OK. A nice airbrush setup with model paints would probably be ideal but I don't have that. The hair will probably wind up just a flat color, not nicely shaded like in the promo art.



>>15333

>silicone

Yes, it feels very nice, with one caveat: right out of the mold it is very sticky, almost like one of those "sticky hand" toys. A light dusting of corn starch fixes this, but it will wear off over time and have to be re-applied. (If you follow the lovedoll scene at all this will be very familiar)



The face is made of Smooth-on 00-30 platinum silicone and was dyed with some cheap dye set from that online bookstore. It was cast in a "simple" 2 part mold with 2 inserts to allow for easy mounting to the head. The back was FDM printed to save money and effort, the front was resin printed. Before casting I had to make a small amount of silicone and apply it to the mating surfaces of the mold to act as a seal. No other prep work was needed.

# 351

I just need tutorials on Bores and connectors. Blender wasn't the problem with my models in terms of scale. It was cura's terrible updates the entire time. 



 Its funny how I modeled a similar joint to your elbow in one of my mech models for the ankles. Would need to integrate servos and some string or other mechanical way to retract the arm for any form of autonomy. Am waiting on a response from RiCOdev on that since translating Inventor/Autocad precision design techniques to blender is not impossible nor difficult.
