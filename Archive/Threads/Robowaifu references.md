You're speaking like you're a part of the managament staff of /robowaifu/. If so do you think you could make a meta thread or general discussion thread? I would make it myself but I was concerned I would get banned for making an off topic thread. 



Also, /monster/ has a bunker of its own on smuglo.li here's the link since If I recall correctly, in the days back on 8chan, /monster/ and /robowaifu/ were allies. In fact, I'd go as far to say they still are.

>You're speaking like you're a part of the managament staff of /robowaifu/. 
Yes. I'm the OG founder of 8/robowaifu.
>If so do you think you could make a meta thread or general discussion thread?
Done. I've restored both the meta and lounge OPs. As with all the other old threads, I'll gradually restore them over time.
>I would make it myself but I was concerned I would get banned for making an off topic thread.
Pfft, please. The only thing I ban are screeching harpies or their white-knights, and actual faggotry.
>Also, /monster/ has a bunker of its own on smuglo.li here's the link since If I recall correctly, in the days back on 8chan, /monster/ and /robowaifu/ were allies. In fact, I'd go as far to say they still are.
Done. Added link back into the welcome bread, and I'll put one back for /clang/ too if I ever find they create a bunker. I'm not sure if there's a cross-site linking technique that works for the webring?
>I am choosing not to sage because I would like the board owner and/or management staff to see this. pls no buli

Its a one-shot story about a guy that takes in a disposed robot who's had her memory erased. This wouldn't be an issue, but she has a bunch of photos of the family she used to work for stashed inside her. I found it to be heart-warming.

# 12
>>90
>I found it to be heart-warming.
That does sound interesting tbh. Vaguely reminds me of a plot point from the 2018 movie ''NextGen''. While it's definitely not a robo''waifu'' movie--quite the opposite--it's still pretty heartwarming in the end. Sort of an "angsty teenage gril living in Neo-Shanghai befriends and Hyper-powerful military grade robot with a heart of gold who saves all mankind" type of story. Kind of like ''Iron Giant'', but in the future not the past. I highly recommend it.

I may have some of the more recent threads saved on a laptop as I also do personal backups. I can upload them if there's any interest or anything missing.



There's also this torrent of 8chan archives floating around, not sure if /robowaifu/ was in it.

OK, I'll repopulate the 'thread archives' thread. I'll probably sort it into post & pre bunker lists. Good idea anon.

I'll migrate your posts there if any entries are different from the copy of the thread I have. I'll be deleting your posts from this thread afterwards, as it's more a meta thing than a robowaifu references thing.

Wanting a robodaughteru has been a long tradition here anon. I think most of us that want families though dream more of actual artificial wombs, with robowaifus in the house to be the other half of raising the kids.

Yeah, the idea sounds fascinating especially since ill likely die a virgin due to my assburgers

# 51

>especially since ill likely die a virgin due to my assburgers
Well, then hopefully you'll have your own robowaifu at the least some day Anon.

# 52
>>2189
Im working on it, slowly. Im a machinist so making parts isnt too difficult, but the electronics and software part is outside my area of expertise. This board helps a lot though

# 53
>>2190
>This board helps a lot though
Cool, glad to hear that. We have a lot more content that hasn't been migrated here to Julay yet. There are also plenty of amateur robotics resources on the intertubes, like hackaday, instructables, and many others. We're sort of like a shitposting hub where anons can bounce ideas off each other and dream of our own robowaifus some day. A few of us are making specific strides towards our goals beyond just talking. A number of us are in Uni, there's one guy who's graduated and now a professional electronics guy, and at least one who is a professional software guy. Hopefully we'll get some ME majors and some practical machinists such as yourself. Personally I think the IB has been a surprisingly good way to network ideas together thus far, and hopefully we'll manage to pull off actual kits for Anons the world over (maybe inside a decade or so?)

# 54
>>2191
If i ever get around to opening my own machine shop, ill make custom parts for /robowaifu/ anons at a discounted price so you guys can afford them. Welding and machining is just as important for building these things as electronics, you dont want your robowaifu to be made from cheap plastic do you?

# 55
>>2185

Even if you were a pedophile, I wouldn't have minded that at all. As long as you don't hurt any real child you're fine in my book.

Plus I don't think lolicon should be directly associated with pedophilia. Lolis are very much different than the real children and as a lolicon/shotacon myself I don't really care about them.

The main reason why most of pedophiles, hebephiles and ephebophiles exists is because because girls get pretty way too early, and stop being cute and adorable way too quickly.

There's also no other way of fixing this other than allowing pedophiles to coom to loli/shota doujinshi. Even if you'd kill all of them, there always will be someone who will eventually get born with attraction to undeveloped females.

>>2187

It's better to die a virgin, than lose your purity to some random whore that doesn't even care about you.

# 56
>>2193
>you dont want your robowaifu to be made from cheap plastic do you?
actually, we do. you said it yourself, these components are a) cheap. this is vital for a global, distributed cottage industry such as robowaifus to get off the ground. my most successful chassis designs thus far are relying in large part on ''drinking straws'' conglomerations to provide light, cheap, structural supports in the form of modular struts. b) they are plastic. again this is going to be an important aspect of this project deeply highlighting the '''DIY''' bit. 3D-printers are both cheap and remarkably capable in producing inexpensive and varied parts.

we will need strong metal parts ofc as well though Anon. Things like spinal cord, shoulder, knee & hip joints. The 'breadbox' housing delicate computer parts. All of these need to be both lightweight and very strong. Metal alloys will serve best in this capacity.

# 57
>>2197
I prefer value and quality. I dont mind spending lots of money on something if its high quality, but to each their own.

# 58
>>2198
Ofc that's desirable. But making this tech accessible to literally millions of men is a high priority here. It actually going to be ''more'' difficult to produce quality kits using inexpensive parts and still create robowaifus that can stand up to abuse.

It's a real balancing act and a fine line we're trying to manage here Anon. And the clock is ticking against us also. Angry feminists have the ear of many lawmakers already. As soon as we start producing actual products there will be a screeching heard around the Western world to (((shut it down))). **Can't have the goys having good things now can we?**

# 59
>>2200
Oy vey dont be antisemitic you dirty goyim

# 60

Model ranges are also a viable option. For instance, there could be "low-end" (of course, we wouldn't call it that) "middle-end" and "high-end" ranges in order to appeal to both budget and luxury markets.

# 61
>>2222
Yes, that's a very reasonable approach anon. In my way of thinking the 'companion robot' industries will have many close analogies with the automobile industries. Model tiers are certainly one of these areas.

I unlinked them if that helps.

# 72

Heh, you must be new. Robitt (aka ''Robi'', the site Admin) recently instigated a kind of spam filter that apparently helped one dumbass from spamming boards here. In the meanwhile, every.single. regular user on the site has to suffer through the annoyance of no longer being able to make short shitposts like
>''Lime a cute tbh.''

We get an error message now, and have to ''re''post our post with some irrelevant and useless addition such as
>''Your post looks like spam. Please adjust it.''

I was merely complaining about make the 99.95% pay for the sins of the .05%, it had nothing to do you you Anon. Apologies.

# 73

BTW, does the spam filter also apply to links (like article, videos etc.)?

# 75
>>4479
I may not have made myself clear so I'll be more explicit:
My comment had nothing to do with your post, and explicitly nothing to do with the number of pictures you posted (5 is the limit w/ Lynxchan). I was merely complaining about Robi forcing us to look at pic related all because of one asshole. Please feel free to post 5 pics with every post you make here, Anon.

Digits confirm. Most of us who want our own robowaifus are probably near broke. But there will be others who can afford the price of a good car for one.

I realize just about very other r/w enthusiast is probably a 2B stan. Chi is really cute but my ideal "final form" would be more mature like 2B. What's not to like she is sexy, yet cute, athletic, yet classy, smart yet sensitive: the total package

# 96

2B has such byoot eyes. Shame about the blindfold. She's deffo top-shelf waifu materials mate.

I am not sure if she couns but Octavia prime is hot as fuck and kinda a robot. She has a great visible/hidden asset ratio. Warframe doesn't seem to start atm but if the game starts i will post my Octavia with good angles. 
I don't play any instrument but i really like how she has soo many in her design, her heels look great with her long legs. I love how her skirt sometimes flaps and shows her perfect ass for a second.

# 101
I had no idea this manga existed but the design for my robowaifu looks and has a similar personality to Asebi from Asebi and Adventurers of Sky World, like a 90% match. I feel like I need to give her bit of a makeover so she doesn't have a My Dear Marie moment one day.
