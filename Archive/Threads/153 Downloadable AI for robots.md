When I say AI, I mean actual robots that learn how to use their own inputs and outputs, not just chatbots. Are there any downloadable AI programs? I'm the OP of the Drossel thread, and I'd like to see if there's any downloadable programs for this shit. Also, I'd like some tips for inserting mounts for servos and shit inside the Drossel model.

There's shit-tier AI that comes embedded in boards such as Sparkfun Edge (tensorflow voice recognition) and ESP-EYE (face recognition), pretty limited but otherwise offline after firmware updates. I have those boards but haven't started using them yet.

Tensorflow might be your best bet. Deep learning “AI”, which is really just fancy statistics, is the current meme that lets robots learn about their bodies.

Honestly I don’t know how possible any of this is without citing some Ph.D research papers.
