There are a lot of robotics research and projects going on out there in the world, many of them with direct application for us here. Please contribute important, quality links you find that you think would help /robowaifu/.

Robot Operating System (ROS)
www.ros.org/
>[ROS] is a flexible framework for writing robot software. It is a collection of tools, libraries, and conventions that aim to simplify the task of creating complex and robust robot behavior across a wide variety of robotic platforms.

IEEE has a nice resource page for robots:

robots.ieee.org/robots/

It's written for normalfaggots, but it's interesting that there's someone out there looking at all the notable robots in the world and compiling a list.

There really needs to me more waifus in those pics.

I feel that this product is essentially a gamechanger;  Japanese twitter exploded the other day.  This robot mimics what robotics competition kits use, only in $500 kit form instead of thousands of dollars in machined metal parts.  It puts a conventional hobby RC car to shame.

www.dji.com/robomaster-s1

What this product does essentially, is to make the First Person Shooter into a live genre.  I've been wondering why a lot of home robot companies fail – such as Anki – one reason they fail is that the consumer gets bored easily.  Imagine a videogame where the location is just one room – your room, and you can only interact or control one character.  You'd play back all of the animation sequences, and that's it.  It's more like the Extras menu when you finish an RPG and unlock all the viewable models rather than get a full experience.  Or its like a basic demo level in a sex game that Illusion makes.  But that's what most of the home robots with apps do, so they are very limited.

To enjoy a robot for a longer time, we need it like we need a full game experience… in this case, it can be used as a first person shooter.

So for a waifubot to survive, it needs a good market… as a toy in a real-world videogame-like application.  It has to be Dual Use.  China is a master in dual-usage… consumer products have military applications as well.  In our case, we can make toys that can turn into sex robots.  But we have to sell them as harmless toys to get that market.

If an FPV land drone tank is the equivalent of the FPS, then what is a legged Waifubot the equivalent of?  How about a fighting game?  Imagine a $500-$1000 waifubot kit that turns your house into an open world RPG with augmented reality enemies.  Will that be the killer app not just for waifubots, but home robots in general?  Some things to ponder.

That would certainly make a nice base for a mobile moebot anon, thanks.

Turns out, they have an extensive stable of products /robowaifu/ might be interested in. I would definitely like to purchase one of these S1's and explore what we can learn from it here.

They have an easily-mastered, Scratch-like programming interface to this system as well.

A Poppy robot that learns to explore the environment and play:

It's an old project but still quite interesting.

>Intrinsically motivated spontaneous exploration is a key enabler of autonomous lifelong learning in human children. It enables the discovery and acquisition of large repertoires of skills through self-generation, self-selection, self-ordering and self-experimentation of learning goals. We present an algorithmic approach called Intrinsically Motivated Goal Exploration Processes (IMGEP) to enable similar properties of autonomous learning in machines.
https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.02190

From the current context it picks a novel object then picks a goal (new outcome) for this object and executes an action to achieve its goal. It tries to predict the object's trajectory from this action and then updates its predictions. It also uses intrinsic rewards of the empirical improvement in solving the goals it generates and the novelty of unexpected outcomes.

That's neat to see teams begin to do mashups with readily available systems. Definitely right up our alley here.

This seems to be a interesting comunity for robotists: https://synthiam.com/Community - with projects and their makers here: https://synthiam.com/Community/Robots?sort=2 - Just found it, so I can't say how good it really is.

A Japanese company created a decent companion robot 5 years ago called Palmi. It remembers what you chat about, comments on unusual things and what you're doing, remembers peoples voices and faces, can have group conversations, and can walk around a bit. It cost $3000 though and didn't get much attention beyond documentaries and exhibitions before being discontinued.

They also made a dancing robot, Premaid AI, for $1500 and a bunch of others but all their robots are discontinued now.

Too bad, but thanks very much for bringing them up for us here Anon. Any idea what the scientists, designers, and engineers who worked on these projects are doing these days? 

Also (silly question since they were obviously commercial endeavors) any chance any of these system software or designs are accessible today?

Kind of a silly little project, but looks like a fun starter project for quads
