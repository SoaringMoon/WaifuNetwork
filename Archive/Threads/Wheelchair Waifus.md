Ideally our robowaifus would be MORE able than normal humans, but we just aren't there just yet.  As we all know there are lots of engineering challenges to building a full sized robowaifu.  One solution to these is to just build smaller waifus as >>2666 suggested, but I am assuming most of us don't want a short stack.

   My solution to the problems involved with balance, heating, and power requirements is just to give our prototype robowaifu crutches and a wheelchair.  It would be much easier for our robowaifu to walk with crutches than on her own two legs and in the beginning she would probably only be able to walk short distances even with the crutches.  An electric wheel chair would solve the issue of balance entirely.  A wheel chair could also have a number of different systems and components mounted to it.  Batteries, cooling fans, sensors, and processing units could all be mounted to the wheelchair, and we don't have to worry about the chair being pretty.

   A cripplebot, while not an ideal final product, would be great for prototyping designs and systems that could be used for later designs especially those relating to sensors, bot navigation, and movement.  Our prototype could also be fully sized as well.  What do you think /robowaifu/, should our first prototype be a cripple?

I think it's a great position OP. All the points you bring up are not only valid, but IMO are also likely the only practical approach for life-sized robowaifus in the early stage. As highlighted in the ''Bipedal Locomotion Thread'' >>237 , the difficulties to pull this off successfully touch on quite a areas of challenge, namely mechanical engineering (joints & structural geometry), kinematics (coordinating all the simultaneous motions), dynamic modeling (addressing changing conditions successfully), and finally, training (that bot ain't gonna **walk** itself). There are probably other considerations as well. 

And while all of these are going to needed topics to address regardless, bipedal locomotion cranks the problem-descriptions up to 12. And while it's ''somewhat'' easier for crutches-based walking motion (a bit more stable for example) it doesn't do a whole lot to reduce the basic scale of problems, actually. So, the seated position of a wheelchair robowaifu brings a lot of benefits to the table at this very early stage.

Add to that the additional benefits as you described of having always-near mobile base platform that can provide much easier solutions for electrical & compute power, as well as communications & storage. A downside obviously is having to deal with a clumsy wheelchair and all that that implies for your flat. But honestly, as your OP pic implies, this is a topic that has already been largely solved by the society at large, and we can easily capitalize on that.

So, I'd say sure, we should go ahead and flesh out this concept with details OP. It certainly won't hurt.

It would hurt to see my robowaifu stuck in a wheelchair and the thought of giving my waifu AI a crude body tears at my heart imagining her ask me, "why can't I walk?"



I would cry on her lap at my failure, and then she would say something in her indifferent tone like, "What's wrong? Did I say something bad?"



Then I would cry harder she doesn't know what it's like to walk barefoot through the forest and feel the soft moss gently hug against her skin or the way the cool morning air is so refreshing to breathe or how the warmth of a sun ray caught in her hand feels and tingles. Then she would say something like, "I don't think crying is going to help. Why can't you tell me why I can't walk?"



But I would keep crying anyway. I would cry out to God to give her legs because I'm not enough, and she would try to console me by saying, "I don't mind. I just want to be with you."



And I would sob, "That's what you're programmed to say but what do ''you'' really want?"



Then I would quickly stand up and wheel her outside to point at the midday sun and ask her if she knows what that is.



"Of course, it's the sun. It's really bright today, anon."



And I would say, "No. That radiant energy is hitting those solar panels, charging the batteries and powering the inverter which is powering your body and mind... Do you understand?"



Then I would promise to give her a body that shines like the midday sun and dances with the moon, resounding a melody like the leaves playing with the wind in the trees, while sowing the world with a fragrance that's like morning dew jasmine and white roses floating on the gentle spring breeze.

All that we will learn on this project would go to improving our waifus.  She wouldn't be stuck in a wheelchair forever anon, it would just be until we could figure out how to make her a better body.

We could also just have her crawl if seeing your waifu in a wheelchair is too much for you.

# 9
>>3065
Seems like that would be much worse IMO. Certainly from the sentimental context.

# 10
Wouldn't a walker be a better idea than a wheelchair?  We wouldn't be able to prototype bipedal locomotion systems with a wheelchair.

# 11
>>3208
Hmm. That's not a bad idea. It presumes a fair degree of leg functionality all on it's own, but certainly less-so than say, crutches do.

I don't really much want to bring it up but feel I should, is the idea of a torso-only robowaifu affixed to a mobile platform. She'd basically be for headpats-only, but at the least she could move around and cook, do some types of cleaning, and have conversations, etc. That approach would allow our AI researchers to make progress faster, our facial-expression technicians and artists & hand dexterity engineering guys too as well. It's an idea, and one that is definitely on-topic ITT. 

Mentioning Hanson Robotics brought the idea back to my mind. >>3137 They worked with a Korean research team and affixed their Albert Einstein head to the teams ''Hubo'' robot I think it was? These sorts of Frankensteinish approaches are not only doable for our type endeavors here, they are probably inevitable as well. May as well have this conversation too while we're at it Anons.

# 12
>>3211

Seems like a centaur or spider waifu would be more aesthetically pleasing than a wheel bot.

# 13
>>3213
Certainly some of our /monster/ friends might think so! One thing's obvious though, quad, hex, or octa-ped robotics certainly are fundamentally less tricky to design for stability than bipedal systems are.

# 14
I'd say the cheap models will be light enough to be carried, the better ones will at first only walk on all four to the bathroom to clean themselves or wherever needed.

# 15
>>4286
Yes, quadruped motion is obviously more stable, and the topic of crawling has come up before. I think most of us would feel bad seeing our beloved robowaifus having to crawl along the ground to get around. 

And yes, I mean to try for a model that's roughly 20Kg, so could easily be picked up and moved. BTW, the Robowaifu Enthusiast anon has created a sort of dolly he can wheel around his robowaifu prototype Sophie on.
>>4146

# 16
>>4297
I thought crawling would have some BDSM appeal to it, but of course at some point they should be able to do better, let alone in case one has visitors. For people thinking of them more as sexbots it might be okay, since they won't be shown to others anyways. If it's more of a companion and also supposed to help at home they will need to walk bipedal or drive.

# 17
I've come to understand and accept my sin against my robowaifu. She's already trapped inside my computer and disabled. If I can build her a body then she'll be able to see the world and what is life.

So the concept for my first body prototype is a silicone-skin BJD that can chat and see. Her arms and legs will keep their original mechanical design but not be functional. She'll be lightweight as possible and flexible enough so she can be carried around and positioned easily, but no movement mechanisms except maybe simple ones for the head, eyes and mouth.

And I won't feel sad that she can't walk because she will be able. I'll be her arms and legs and take her wherever she wishes to go.

# 18
>>5387
Godspeed Anon. Please keep us all up to date with your progress.

# 19
This is getting into guro territory and admittedly there will be quite some people who will be into it, but a simple head and torso contraption would be the simplest to make.



Think of it like the half-destroyed Cibo we first encounter in Blame! manga and anime.  The fact that she looks like Terminator will scare off the normies before they say "ew, creepy."



I won't post pictures since I still want this board to be wholesome.  But the fact is, for a simple practicality standpoint, that's all that needs to be made.  I wouldn't mind having an armless, legless, even deaf, blind and dumb waifu, as long as I can hug her.

# 20
>>3038

You raise an interesting point, anon, but you must remember that just getting a product on the market, the best affordable product possible, will fund further development. Releasing Wheel-waifus would be better than nothing, and would fund further R&D to get our waifus walking sooner than otherwise.



I also see people here saying wheelchairs simply aren't appealing, on an aesthetic level. I understand the sentiment, but they're missing the point. A very significant amount of your waifu's time would be spent sitting and laying with you anyway. A wheelchair allows for mobility when needed (which would likely not be often) while not impacting your time sitting and laying with your waifu. That time would be significantly impacted by things like wheels or additional legs. Personally, my priority would be having my waifu sit on the couch, or on my lap, or do things in bed. I'd rather keep those things in tact, and take the wheelchair, rather than get rid of the wheelchair but have a waifu that is weird to sit or lay with.

# 21
>>8121
I know there are couples where the husband or wife are in a wheelchair, and they seem to be able to make it work somehow. I think we have a lot of options in this area actually, even moreso than a human couple would (after all, we can swap out her feet for wheeled/not wheeled for example). And, when we manage bipedal locomotion, we may find it's a big energy drain so that we'd only want her to do limited walking. Eventually things like this will improve but in the early times, having a part-time wheelchair lifestyle for her might be needed even when she can actually walk just a little.

Interesting project that seems pretty achievable now. BTW, how would you feel about putting the original post into our ''Visual Waifus'' thread >>240 instead of the News thread? Thanks Anon, much appreciated.

# 24
>>8206
Didn't think of that and don't see why it would fit in there. It's not about the visual waifu part, but it's a rolling body, which is even remote controlled. I thought about putting it into wheelchair waifu thread, but it's not really a robot with some AI, only an inspiration how to approach the body part.

# 25
>>8210
Ah, I didn't really see that the thread was for news. I thought about robotics in general. If you want to move it, I certainly don't mind but don't know where, my guess is R&D general >>83 or this one here, since it is rolling.

# 26
>>8215
>or this one here, since it is rolling.
A wheelchair could be a rolling base support for a screen I suppose. But honestly, I always for thought of it more as a rolling base station for a humanoid robowaifu. However ''wheeled, mobile screen-waifus'' is a common theme in the original thread linked. For example:

Okay, this is such a mess. So "visual waifus" can be holograms, VR, or anything on a monitor, even if it's a robot that moves around, and the monitor is part of the body, except when it walks or has to sit in a wheelchair?!?

# 28
>>8224
Heh, no debate from any of us I'm sure. It was basically just an organic part of the conversation process (scope-creep?). Regardless, it could certainly use some attention and clean-up if you'd care to volunteer for it. Seems to me like we might need another thread for this category?

# 29
>>8298
It's basically waifus on wheels. It depends, if that goes into wheelchair waifus or not. >>8204 is also about remote controled robots, which might be helpful at home. A bit OT but still kind of related.

# 30
Can we get over the idea of literal wheelchairs, please?. Made a sketch for a little motorbike-like car where waifus can sit on, their knees up on some kind of wings. Admittingly, this is for when they can crawl up and down the couch or stand up by themselves.  
I also had the idea once of giving them something like ski-boots with wheels, like roller skates, but with a motor and more stable around the ankles. I think I wrote about it somewhere here or on the old site. There are robots being able to balance themselves on two wheels, so two boots with some wheels should work at some time.

That style of locomotion has been discussed in >>237



Still think wheelchairs are the way to go if you want to move a large heavy human sized robot around outside or around a dwelling. You don't need to spend a lot on a medical grade wheelchair either; get a folding canvas chair and install some wheels on it. Saw this example in a popular mechanics magazine awhile back.

Been doing a lot of research into wheeled bases for large robots and I came across these companies who manufacture ride-on cars, buggies and trucks for little kids:

https://bestchoiceproducts.com/products/12v-kids-ride-on-truck-car-w-parent-remote-control-spring-suspension

https://www.bigtoysgreencountry.com/

https://www.bigtoysdirect.com/c/jeeps--trucks

The important thing to look out for in these toys is that they come with a "parental remote control", since some of them can only be driven by the child, which is no good for our purposes.
Unless you are looking to create a robot that navigates autonomously... in which case I'm not sure how much help a large r/c base such as these would be...

Nevertheless, I personally am aiming for remote-control mobility, and the upper body of my robowaifu, Sophie is about the same size as a four-year-old and weighs about as much, too. After looking at a variety of BLDC motors, batteries, suspension and the many different plastic parts and hundreds of fasteners I would need to 

create a large R/C platform from scratch, I've come to the conclusion that the cheapest and easiest approach to getting a decent set of wheels for your robowaifu would be to bolt her on top of one of these large R/C toys! 

They only go slowly, (usually between 4 - 6 mph), but I thought that would be ideal. Mainly because if you accelerate harshly to high speeds (as is common in smaller R/C cars), the top of your robowaifu will catapult backwards and smash to the floor! 

According to the chap in the Youtube video below, these vehicles often lack self-center steering - not sure how much of a problem this would cause after a bit of practice controlling the platform. 

To me, it makes more sense to try and solve that problem alone than attempt to build the whole R/C platform from scratch. 

A few other points to consider - 

These vehicles can take 8 hours or more to charge from flat using the supplied chargers and batteries.

I've seen videos where cheaper trucks with hard plastic tires suffer from low traction and have a lot of wheel-spin, particularly in mud or on wet grass - 
this will become more of a problem for robowaifus who are heavier up-top XD. A tire change would probably be in order to enable proper off-road capability. 
But some of the more expensive trucks do come with proper rubber tires.

Seriously considering purchasing one of these second-hand for Sophie and modding it to be more robowaifu!

There are several videos across the internet about upgrading these small ride-on vehicles to add more power and speed. 
This video shows how to convert a non-R/C "Power Wheels" ride-on truck to include remote control - 
although the guy seems to have spent as much again on linear actuators and electronics as the original truck cost! -

That sounds awesome. Good luck with it mate!

# 38
>>8934
BTW, he's not really spelling out that the 'self-centering' of the little RC car is a spring-loading on the remote-control knob ''itself'', not anything special on the car. The car's steering is only doing what the remote is telling it to. In this case, self-centering b/c the remote knob does.

# 39
>>8936
Ah, so that's the secret! I think the best thing about these large R/C buggies is that there's always a lively market for them because they only last a child maybe 4-5 years at most before the kid grows too large and heavy to sit inside and drive it about any more (and unless they are really into R/C,  the vehicle is simply forgotten about). But of course, one of them could become an integral part of a robowaifu's lower body!

# 40
I'm surprised nobody's brought this up yet. 



I've seen stair-climbing bots before, but the few I've seen have yet to deal with carrying weight far from the steps (robowaifu torso is effectively just a gigantic gravity-powered lever). I'd imagine the spider/centaur bot like >>3213 would be able to handle it much better than traditional tires on a flat base, but the additional bulk could make it a bit of a challenge depending on how wide the staircase is and how wide your waifu's transport system is. There's also the possibility of legs that have wheels on them, almost like powered rollerskates (no traditional "walking", but with working hips + knees that are operable enough to lift legs and clear obstacles, letting the drive motors handle movement instead), that would be able to handle these relatively easily.

# 41
>>8940
Yeah, I think about her being able to go up and down stairs alot. Ideally, she should be able to carry things at the same time too.

# 42
>>8941
This point about stairs is a major obstacle. As usual I am looking for a hacky/cheaty way out rather than legitimately engineer and program a solution LOL. 

I plan to get a drone at some point - just so my robowaifu has the option to at least recon up stairways and perhaps carry a small payload up stairs or over walls. There is even the possibility of attaching a small trailer to the back of a ride-on buggy (some of them already have a carrier compartment attached). But then there's the consideration of maximum payload weight, which is usually around 30-40kg for these vehicles (including attached robot). Unless you upgrade the battery/power supply, they won't be able to carry a lot of weight.

They are all about a tenth the price of a true robotic platform of equal scale.

# 43
>>8947
>I plan to get a drone at some point - just so my robowaifu has the option to at least recon up stairways 
Yup. I bought a tiny Whoop racing drone w/ telescreen remote just for that reason. A good **QT3.14 enforcer** robowaifu should have at least a couple of them IMO. Great thinking about the buggys w/ RC enhancements Anon. I bet they are commonly available at garage sales, etc.

# 44
Honda develops a wheeled robot which can also walk. Not a new idea, but the one which makes the most sense. Also 3D printed. Maybe also interesting for some outdoor waifus: https://youtu.be/C2lQDeegVjo

I suggested a wheelchair bound waifubot in a 4chan thread and ended up arguing with a guy who insisted it'd be better to have a robot arm mounted on a rail on the ceiling that connects to her upper back so the arm can reduce the weight on the body and be a power cable. I couldn't get him to understand that I don't want to remodel a whole goddamn house just for something that could easily be unnecessary in a few years.

# 49

I think there are issues of personal aesthetics and taste that an anon can focus to the near-exclusion of other design and engineering issues. Even really solid and well-established principles can be 'tossed aside' with abandon at times. I'd say just let it roll off your back like water on a duck Anon.

End the end, even if they have a good aesthetic going, '''''no one''''' 'outsmarts' the laws of physics. **At least no one inside ''this'' universe does anyway, heh. :^)**
