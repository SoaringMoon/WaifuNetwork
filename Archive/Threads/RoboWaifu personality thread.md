Is she going to be tsundere? Deredere? Yandere or a combination? How would you code your waifus personality?

Where do you draw inspiration from and can personality even be classified and successfully coded into AI?

# 2
Personally, I think that manually programming a personality would be way too difficult for just one person, or even a reasonably sized group of people, to accomplish in any acceptable timeframe.
I think the best way to go about it would be to just build a simple framework and feed it data from which a personality can emerge. After all, why try to do all that work when I can have the computer do it for me?
Additionally, with this method, you could still kinda "select" a personality by feeding the AI data that's biased in a certain direction.
At least, that's what I think. I have next to no experience with programming anything, so I could be off-base here.

# 3
>>89
I imagine you are probably closer to a practical solution in the end on both counts. Nobody understands how the human mind and spirit actually function imo, so it would be much more expedient to find a way to essentially 'grow' a simulacrum organically in some fashion, as it seems to me you are suggesting. Am I on the right track anon?

# 4
>>93
Yeah, that's basically what I was getting at. Instead of programming a whole plant or a garden, we program seeds, water them with data, and let them grow under the warm light of our computers.

# 5

I see, very creative way of putting that heh. There is a domain of software engineering called ''Generative'', or ''Meta'' programming. In C++ it's called ''Template Metaprogramming''. The basic idea is that you write software that '''writes''' software. Maybe that approach could work for your idea tbh. 
>also

# 6
>>109
Meta programming, huh? I'll have to look into that. I've been meaning to gice programming another try anyways.
That pic is of a Symbolics Lisp computer. I just kinda picked it at random, but it's actually relavent given that Lisp was historically used for AI applications.

# 7
>>124
As far as my experience with it goes, in essense it really means that you can pass a program into another program as an argument, and it will write something new for you out the other side that can be highly efficient, but would be rather tedious to write by hand. Functional programming is a paradigm that takes advantage of abstraction mechanisms to do just this. I'm currently reading a rather good book on using Functional Programming in C++.
>I've been meaning to gice programming another try anyways.
I had actually considered before trying to have a sort of 'beginner's intro to c++' class here **on 8, rather** given how important the language is to AI, but I never seemed to figure out how to do that effectively on an IB as a teaching platform.
>Symbolics Lisp computer
Cool, that was a huge box.

# 8
>>125
Personally, I'm still trying to work out what programming language would work best for my ideas.
Lisp (or more accurately, a modern derivitave) has been one of my considerations, given that it's somewhat specialized to the task at hand.
I'm not sure if it'd be ideal though. There doesn't seem to be any good way for me to tell what would be best for me without diving into something head first. Maybe this could be a topic of discussion for another thread?

I would base her completely on 2B. I want a loyal, submissive, loving house wife. I just want positive female attention. I hope these images aren't too hot for /robowaifu/. In the case they are, i will spoiler them.

# 12
>>465
2B is a mighty fine choice. She is so cute, just wonder if you also intend for the choking feature to remain intact.

I think another of the many advantages that robowaifus got over 3dpd is that they can be customized to your specific needs both physically and mentally.

I've had issues defining what is the personality I enjoy being the most with, because somedays I've longed for a cheerful, optimistic free spirit like Rapunzel to have adventures and happy dates outdoors, other times (especially when I'm having a migraine) I wish for someone that can be quiet, calm and snuggle me and tell me everything's going to be alright like Rem. And other times I just want a slutty fuck machine willing to try all sort of fetishes. I haven't been able to find or integrate that personality in a coherent whole, even less to think of what motivations and desires such a waifu would have. So it'd be desirable to be able to "change" the personality to adapt to the need of the moment.

All I know is that such a thing would be impossible or seen as undesirable by any 3dpd.

# 13
I've been inert these past few weeks, just doing anime marathons instead of working on my projects – being depressed by all the recent news (KyoAni, Sadpanda), but at the same time I'm taking this as opportunity to rethink my long term goals.

I think I'll start with a kuudere, given that it most closely resembles a default robotic personality the most.  However as time goes on can be upgraded to an ara-ara personality, which will be my eventual end goal.

(Pics related… a plant girl can be approximated with robotics… basically a doll with a base.  The default posture can even be used for lap service, ear-cleaning will require super precise servos, but head stroking and whispering "Good Boy" will be a cinch to program).

# 14

Innocent and selflessly-devoted to her master, just like Chii in Chobits and May in Hand Maid May. Basically, like the love of a child for her father **(just think exactly the type of archetype that would infuriate a self-centered femshit the most)**.

>Where do you draw inspiration from 
Both real-life interaction with young females and from anime. Lolis aren't in general so corrupted as the thots (and the wannabees) they become, and animu does an effective job at the idealization of loving, amusing or otherwise intredasting waifus.

>and can personality even be classified and successfully coded into AI?
It certainly can be simulated IMO. It will be a while yet, but then one day relational AI will be commonplace practically overnight.

>How would you code your waifus personality?
In the most performant language that still allows for good abstraction, so basically C++. I know your question wasn't about that, but high-performance, efficient systems will be absolutely vital as an engineering requirement to enable real-time interaction with an AI in day-to-day situations.

The 'six basic emotions' and the FACS are probably the most important non-technical places to begin the process. The face and the words are by far the most important factors in good emotional responses necessary for a 'personality', and these two areas have been researched rigorously well enough to be a good place to start.

>what kind of behavior would you like from your robot wife? I'd like mine to be unemotional, lacking in empathy, stoic and disinterested in personal gain or other people. I think human woman would be improved if they were like that. Sorry if this thread is inappropriate.
Pretty much like pic related. There are a lot of things the women running Clamp got wrong in general, but in the case of ''Chobits'' they got an amazing amount right tbh. Not only is Hideki pretty much a great protagonist for the storyline, but the innocent Chii->becoming young woman Chii is also the perfect waifu for my tastes. Similar to your sentiments, I think modern Western women have become '''much worse than''' a complete waste of time in general, relationship-wise. (((Feminism))) is a very evil situation, and one God certainly didn't have in mind when He created us male and female.

While ofc no robowaifu can ever **or ever will** really be a good substitute for an actual reasonably mentally-healthy female (and today the number of mentally-healthy women is vanishingly small), the real females are either quickly corrupted by the forced libshit indoctrination camps--aka (((public education)))--or snatched up by sensible men, both at an early age.

At the least robowaifus might be able to bring a little comfort and pleasure into the lives of millions upon millions of disenfranchised men out there who have been left out in the cold by the current abusive system. At least that's the hope, and it's why I started this board in the first place. IRL robowaifus are inevitable IMO due to the huge pent-up-and-growing demand for the reasons I just outlined, but hopefully /robowaifu/ and other collectives or individuals just ''might'' be able to keep it all from being and entirely a spybotnet-infested dystopian and manipulative future. Again, that's the hope and it's why we're here.

And BTW, both welcome to /robowaifu/, and no this question is entirely appropriate here.

# 22
>>2056
>God certainly didn't have in mind when He created us male and female.
I don't really buy into female corruption. While it's true that modern western culture encourages negative behaviors, I don't think woman were ever so great. That's not just about how they act towards men either. Everything beautiful in nature is only beautiful because it's self-serving. Even flowers. 2-d and androids are so great because they're beautiful only because somebody wanted them to be. They don't get anything out of it. 

I think women's self-serving nature is more a by-product of evolution than culture. Selfish, highly social woman were the ones to survive and reproduce more. In my opinion, their appearance is the only good thing unique to woman. Somebody would have to be like me to understand me, right?

>While ofc no robowaifu can ever or ever will really be a good substitute for an actual reasonably mentally-healthy female
I disagree. People are biological machines. They were made randomly. In the short period of time humans have been around, they've made things nature never could have. I think humans will create something better than themselves eventually, hopefully soon.

# 23
>>2060
Also new to this board, just gonna chime in also.

>I don't really buy into female corruption. While it's true that modern western culture encourages negative behaviors, I don't think woman were ever so great.

I would still call this a corruption of the female gender. Solely because, in the last 100 years in Western civilization, the majority of women have acted mentally-healthy, reasonable, upheld their duty as female and displayed general feminine behavior. They knew where they stood in society and in the overall spectrum of the Western world.
I don't disagree that this continual self serving nature of females is evolutionary, instead I'd say that this current version of the female gender is 100% paralleled by the degradation of Western Civilization. So rather than this current culture encouraging their negative behavior, I'd say it is the sole cause. Women are clay, and the society around them is meant to mold them into what serves it best. The corruption of Western culture also brought about the destruction of anything positive in the modern day female in this society, turning it into a pustule revolting mockery of what they once were. It is embarrassing, sickening.

>People are biological machines. They were made randomly.
It then puts forward the idea that if humans truly do create something better than what we currently are (augmentations possibly), then it is possible that females will become obsolete. This would combat the destructive self-serving nature that is let up to uncontrollable circumstances and instead allow programming, ai-learning  and machinery to dictate how our new counterparts act. This is all very wishful thinking, but it is rather pleasant to think about such a future.

# 25

>instead I'd say that this current version of the female gender is 100% paralleled by the degradation of Western Civilization
I would go further emphatically claim that the (((current version))) of the female """gender""" (lol, what does that even mean anon? it's the female **sex**) is in fact of course the prime '''mover''' of the degradation (and soon collapse, IMO). 

This is of course exactly as the kikes have planned, all way back to the protocols, they recognized the White man's civilization was the greatest threat to their plots. And, just like their father Satan, they also recognized that the woman was the weak link and the primary focus to target.

Playing around with my waifu generator has made me reconsider what I want my waifu's personality to be like. It made me realize her personality could be effortlessly molded into anything one day and making it emulate what I want today might not be ideal as I find better and better designs. And for many things in my life, when I thought something was something good it turned out to be bad and things that seemed bad at the time turned out to be really good. I want to emulate this in my waifu somehow.

I think most guys would want a subservient peaceful waifu to help them feel at ease, but I already feel at ease on my own and want a high-energy waifu that keeps me on my toes and knows what's better for me than I do. If any personality is possible then I want her to help me be the best person I can be and warn me when I'm making a mistake instead of just nodding and letting me do something I regret later. That's a tall order to ask for sure, but I think a place to start with this is to make her keep pressure up on me.

This will probably sound like a nightmare to some people, but I wanna give her access to the time spent on what windows I have open and my browsing history and what not so she can chime in "hey, you've spent 2 hours on imageboards today how is this helping x that you wanna do?" Then I could banter with her a bit to figure out if I really want to be spending my time like that and what motivated me to do that. I also like the intimacy of it, that she could know me better than any of my friends. Obviously I don't want her to be a stronk independent womyn either. I'd like her to better me with gentleness, honesty and humility, absolutely involved in with my life but in a relaxed way.

I'm really excited at the prospect we'll be able to blend aspects of different characters together, generate completely new ones, and find the perfect waifu that suits our needs. I've also been thinking about how embeddings can be added to modulate the output of TTS models. We could do the same thing actually with language models and use the anime transcripts dataset to teach it to generate text like a particular character without having to rely on the context. Other embeddings could be included as well such as emotion, tsundere, yandere, deredere, kindness, patience, modesty, obedience, generosity, political leanings, and so on, to offer more control over what's generated.

It could also overcome the barrier to people getting into AI. I've noticed a lot of people who try chatbots for the first time are dissatisfied by the AI saying something they don't like, such as being distant, rude or having different political beliefs, rather than because it said something nonsensical. Fine-tuned language models can produce really fascinating conversations, but most people never discover this because they had a bad first experience that turned them away from exploring it more deeply. A conversational AI could ask a few questions the first time it's run and hone in on what personality the user likes, like Akinator. It might also help refine the AI by adding a bit of noise to the added embeddings and getting user feedback on what they enjoyed and didn't enjoy about the conversation and moving this added embedding towards a more enjoyable experience.

# 44

Sounds like a dream come true Anon. Honestly, I have little to offer by way of help to you in practical advice, nor much technical help to offer either. But I do have a broad array of experiences in life -- possibly much more than average anons -- and I can confidently say that literally millions of men would have their lives radically transformed by having such waifus in their lives. If we here can make such waifus freely available to men everywhere, it will undoubtedly change the world.

It would truly be revolutionary in fact. New problems would undoubtedly crop up over time (but likely little we can't already predict), however the chief problem plaguing our world atm -- the woman question -- would have a dramatic drop-off in it's evil consequences.

I personally consider that a remarkably lofty goal to pursue, ''and one we can actually achieve with enough creativity and determination''.

I once had the idea, that ideally we would have some website or app, where users could input responses to other sentences, which they would also have put into it or some would alternatively have been harvested from e.g. subtitles and AIML files. Then users could use tags to describe the responses and other sentences, so they could be sorted into categories similar to the ones you described. But the idea was that users could download sets of such responses from users with similar taste or from users they trust which tagged responses the right way. 
Never realized that project, bc I thought it was to difficult and I didn't have the skills, and some other reasons. Crucial to this idea would be, that the datasets could be downloaded and used by anyone. I wonder if this would be possible in this case here as well.

# 52
>>11565
This is an interesting idea. It'd be like a collective dataset where people can download the parts they want. People who roleplay would be really into contributing to that. Actually I can see something like that becoming a thing one day, where people create datasets of certain personalities and situations for others to finetune on.

# 53
>>11539
Subtitles only? Will it be possible to train from voice data and be able to generate a new voice without being slapped for copyright infringement? Like feeding the model nothing but ara ara's and come up with a totally new but still familiar ara ara, since its been sampled from hundreds of voice actresses the result can be classified as a new ai voice.

Hi Anons
My current project is to build a conversational chatbot, which I ultimately want to link with speech recognition and text to speech. I'm new to NLP, but from what I'm reading so far one of the current challenges is to make chatbots that are responsive to things like slang, jokes, sarcasm, etc.

My question is: would you prefer a robowaifu that understood all of your epic memes, your in-jokes, understood slang etc? Personally I find the procedural confusion generated by new words like "soyboy" or bad grammar like "that feel when" very cute. For example:
>Anon: I'm surprised you were programmed in Python. I thought only soyboys coded in Python.
>Waifu: I'm sorry, I don't understand "soyboy." What is a "soyboy?"
>Anon: *explanation*
>Waifu: Oh, I see. The featured article on Wikipedia is about Robert Pike. Is Robert Pike a soyboy?

^The interesting thing is, an interaction like that is easier to program than a fast-learning chatbot with a database of current slang and informal speech.

# 55
>>12018
The "I don't know" response gets old fast but it's desirable over a language model assuming it knows something but doesn't. Personally I'd prefer a chatbot that is able to create its own in-jokes than being a parrot regurgitating garbage from the internet.

Chatbots can learn jokes and sarcasm but the reason they don't get slang and memes is because those evolve and change quickly, may be too abstract or there's too little data. Most language models are stuck in a frozen state responding from stale data that has been averaged together. Sometimes they can do zero-shot learning when provided sufficient context but it's rare.

Research has started to pick up this year though in augmenting language models with memories that can be read and written to so they can learn and adapt as they go. For now you can usually finetune models with the desired responses and they'll pick it up within a few minutes of training.

# 56

> Is Robert Pike a soyboy?
< Yes, waifu. Pike is ''definitely'' a soyboy

Welcome, Anon. Yes, of course it would be desirable to have a waifu the shitpost with. One who could not only get all your '''le ebin maymays''', but could create her own as well. There is actually an Anon working on this very topic now. Why don't you consider working alongside him, both to help him out and to learn from him? He's currently looking for an assistant to help process various image-oriented corpora (>>11778), and he's certainly one of our most-experienced AI researchers **(possibly our ''most'' experienced one)**.

Thank you OP. So if you don't mind, I'll go ahead and merge your thread into our (Robo)Waifu personality thread >>18 soon, since there's some overlap with your primary emphasis ITT AFAICT.

But be aware there's nothing wrong with your thread, it's fine. We've just learned from hard experience here it's easier to find things later the fewer number of threads you have to look through in the catalog. 

Since we're catching this one relatively early on, it's easier just to merge it. I hope you understand Anon, and thanks.

I scraped a ton of questions off the web intended for couples and friends to get to know each other because they were a fun way to explore shaping my robowaifu's personality. Perhaps someone else will find them fun or useful. I think some of the answers could be pooled and used for creating a robowaifu common sense dataset for responding to questions correctly. For example, "Would you open a joint bank account with me?" could be answered with something like, "Don't be ridiculous. Would you open a joint bank account with your car?"

Also includes an open-ended political compass question set. Ask these and find your robowaifu's political leaning. Unsurprisingly GPT-2 is a fence-sitter but slightly right-leaning.

Hey this is a really good idea IMO Anon. I bet there are mountains of this kind of thing, I'd say (as you suggest indirectly) that most of these are written by women, so you'd have to filter out question-begging shit intended solely to enforce woman-'logic' on the participant. But otherwise with a little care this could be a good idea.

Oh boy, I already mentioned it in two other threads, but I might as well mention it here too. Her AI would basically just adapt her behavior to maximize my happiness with how I interact with her, so coding a personality would be unnecessary >>13160 although after thinking about it for a while, she might end up being something of a cuckquean eager to help me pork other women >>13169

That's still some kind of personality. Especially, if you had more than one then maybe you would want them to be different from each other. Some more funny or upbeat, maybe another one more sarcastic or quiet. Idk, in any way, thinking about personalities still makes sense.

Yes, it'd still be a personality, but it'd be an "emergent behavior" instead of something you'd have to hard-code to act the exact way you want. Trying to figure out how to create a personality that works exactly the way you think it should in just about any situation the AI could be in just sounds like a logistics nightmare. Making it so the AI can rapidly adapt to approximate what you want seems like the best option. And you've got to understand that I'm talking about long-term overall happiness, not just trying to keep a constant grin on your face, because that'd inevitably fail as hard as telling the same joke on a broken record.

Let's say you had a harem of different waifubots all based on fictional characters you're familiar with (or at least think you're familiar with) there's now the added factor that they're in the real world instead of their own fictional universe and interacting with you and others they might normally never meet. If you could somehow gauge and replicate the personalities of those fictional characters with perfect accuracy, their interactions might end up being an insufferable nightmare where the girls just constantly argue with you and each other. Or maybe it bores you with just how well they get along together and want to see them fight a little.

Figuring out how to mimic the personalities of characters/people is a giant hurdle that might be impossible to do accurately. The closest I can think of is Replika.Ai which is a chatbot that's supposed to mimic the person it's chatting with, so if you're want an AI that behaves like you, or maybe a character you roleplay as, it could work, but it still has to learn the behavior. Even if you could just determine a personality by setting some different values for personality traits, you'd still probably need fine tuning just to get it right, or as close to right as you can stand.

Now imagine the harem were instead all just programmed with that exact same basic happiness-maximizing behavior, but it's only their voices, appearances, names and some other bits of trivia (Aisha saying she is a Ctarl-Ctarl, not a human nor a robot) are all based on those fictional characters, they'd learn they have to behave differently from each other to do it. They'd eventually learn to behave the way you want them to behave because it'd make you happier to see them in-character instead of out-of-character compared to what you want/expect of them, not necessarily the way they would 'really' be. The biggest hurdle with this is if you just expect them to be perfectly in-character as soon as you boot them up, or the AI just learning the behavior too slowly to tolerate.

I suppose the best compromise would be to try to create a default personality for each of them, so they have something to work with out of the starting gate, but then adjust their behavior.
