So let's kick things off ITT with the ongoing conversation about the board and it's users. This relocated here from a couple of threads, so please be patient with me Anons. I'll follow up with my own responses to the conversation following after.

# 3
>>15387
Okay Chobitsu, I will try to be sensible. Actually on a more serious note, I took a look at the 'Boards' page of alogs.space recently and /robowaifu/ only has 4 unique IPs. I assume these are yourself, AllieDev, Kiwi and I? Maybe sometimes we get MetaRonin and RiCo dev and a couple of other anons (ofc users could be posting under two different names). But I have checked a few months back as well, and there were just six unique IPs using the board then, too.

If there are only four or five guys here intermittently I am not sure internet messageboards are the best way to approach the whole "robowaifu" concept. Don't get me wrong, they're fun...but effective? Debatable.

I know you want to keep a small group of dedicated/autistic individuals. But there is a point where one has to consider; has the size of the group dwindled to such an extent that it will negatively impact the future progress of the engineering project? Then the next question would be; how can I increase the reach and membership of said engineering project?

Personally, I would start by renaming the board to "robot girlfriends" just because that is what a lot of guys will Google search for. Many people will be completely unfamiliar with the term "waifu", never mind "robowaifu". Maybe that would increase footfall and interest? It's a niche hobby to start with, so it needs to be as easy to find as possible for potential new recruits.

# 4
>>15436
This discussion belongs in the meta thread. 
There are very few unique IP's and considering I'm two of them, that's somewhat concerning. I don't particularly mind being in a small close community but, people fill out natural niches. I'm an industrial manufacturing engineer and very poorly suited at planning and modeling organic designs. Moving forward, we should work on figuring out what niche we all play. Chobitsu should naturally lead us, so that us few can best use our talents.

# 5
>>15436
Even if there is only 4 of us, what would be a better place? I like not being on one of the big social media platforms.

>growing
This is a big issue. The venn diagram of "I make robots" and "I want to date/fuck robots" is practically 2 circles. Really, there's 3 groups:

- A: The engineers. They're generally opposed to human-like robots and see building them as a futile waste of time, because we don't yet have the technology to make them cook and clean, nor are they the ideal design for such a robot if we did.
- B: The ones that want companion/"friend" robots. These mostly gravitate towards less-human-like designs. They're not interested in intimacy or sex. They generally settle for toy robots or do nothing and move along.
- C: People sexually interested in androids/fembots/etc. They almost never have a making or engineering background. They consider their fetish pure fantasy, satisfying themselves via media and role-playing.

The only group here that could reasonably build robowaifus is A, but they're also the least interested in it. Group B has some drive to build but would rather build a Jibo for 10% of the effort it would take to build a robowaifu-style platform. This group is also pretty small. Finally, group C often doesn't even *want* IRL robots. Additionally, not only are robot builders and the few that desire robowaifu 2 entirely different demographics, but there's a MASSIVE social stigma that has to be overcome. 

Imagine you're in a hypothetical meetup with other engineers to show off your projects. Engineer 1, a factory automation expert, has built a system that automatically sorts parts from an injection molding machine and analyzes them for defects. Engineer 2 is a researcher and is working on improved gaits for quadruped robots. Engineer 3 specializes in robotic lawn mowing and has created a DL model for detecting hoses, sticks, holes and more in residential yards. And then there's you: "yeah, I built her, her name's Alice, she's my wife, she says cute stuff and I can fuck her." You WOULD get laughed out of the room, and told to come back whenever you have a useful, impressive or cutting-edge system to show off. So even if you had a *bit* of interest, peer pressure would take care of that for you.

A lot of this knowledge I've gathered from looking for people interested in androids (very human-like robots, not phones you goof!). Robowaifu suffers the same problem but even more pronounced due to an even smaller interested group and even more stigma.

>mfw he knows
Perfect analysis! I just lurk here, because like you said, i put just 10% of the effort required. Also your hypothetical scenario is why i believe that we wont have robot companions so early, normies will just swear us.
Robowaifu really is the best place for this.

Then the next question would be; how can I increase the reach and membership of said engineering project?

I wouldn't consider it too much of a problem. If you'd been paying attention to the events of the last few years, you'd know that once something goes mainstream, it often gets co-opted and turned to evil very quickly. 

Our community seems to have always been more like an enclave that calls to very few individuals where everyone builds their own project from what I've seen in the archives.

>>15437
I wouldn't police his comments on how small the community is since it's one of his own threads and not disrupting anything. 
.
>Moving forward, we should work on figuring out what niche we all play.

I would be careful about trying to pigeonhole anons into specific roles. 

As I've seen and experienced, being a jack of all trades is a far more successful approach than being extremely good in one or two fields.

Welcome to the new meta thread

>>15438
Another major problem is many do not understand just how limited our technology actually is. Things like 2B and Chii are not currently possible unless you want her constantly plugged into mains power with an external computer running her neural nets on RTX cards. It's truly frustrating being in group A and wanting a Persocom since childhood only to realize just how far we are from them. But, we must keep our hopes and efforts high. We already have competition that we must beat to market in Lilium Robotics that wants to patent and control the waifus. https://liliumrobotics.com/Standard-Android/ So, making an open source waifu as soon as possible would be best. There is still much we can do. If you can accept limitations, then you can still build a lovely waifu.

I agree wholeheartedly, we have a level of security through our obscurity.

>The engineers. They're generally opposed to human-like robots and see building them as a futile waste of time.



I think the engineers are correct.



Don't get me wrong - I'd still like to build a singing robot/rudimentary chatbot, just for hobby/entertainment purposes. But that's all she'll be. Does that count as a "waifu"? I dunno. I have had to vastly reduce the scope of my project as I learned more about electronics, robotics, A.I. and it's costs, difficulty and limitations. The massive (54%) increase in energy costs currently afflicting the U.K. isn't helping me either. 



> Even if there is only 4 of us, what would be a better place?



Only having four people is a massive issue. Not trying to be negative here, just realistic. Boston Dynamics has around 300 employees, many of whom are VERY experienced and specialised full-time engineers and programmers. Yet they have been struggling since 1992 to make a bipedal robot that can function safely around humans (Atlas is not yet ready for proving ground or public trials - it still falls over a lot, and if it fell over at the wrong time/place it would badly injure or even kill a child).



Engineered Arts, which makes entertainment robots and is much more closely aligned to what /robowaifu/ is trying to achieve has just 25 employees (unknown how many work full-time).



But importantly, both companies have money. Boston Dynamics in particular has LOTS of money - it was recently aquired by Hyundai Motor Group for $880,000,000. Fuck me sideways with an end effector.



Engineered Arts must at least have an annual budget within the low seven-figure range considering their payroll, business premises and the fact that their AMECA robots cost $133,000 each (as quoted by their CEO, Will Jackson) - and they have at least two AMECAs in development, along with a whole bunch of other, older (but still advanced) robots like Mesmer.



If the goal of /robowaifu/ is to create an advanced humanoid robot - even a non-bipedal one (with it's own A.I. that isn't dependent upon the big-tech cloud servers like my Sophie...and is at least on-par with or better than Replika)... then we are going to need a lot more than 4 strangers over the internet sharing a library of online references and lots of wishful thinking. 



A shitload of cash and many connections to willing robotics/animatronics industry insiders would be a good start.



Sorry if this dashes anyones hopes and dreams but when I am in serious mode, this is just how I am.

>>15438

>doomfagging



I seriously doubt 300+ "people" conspiring against each other all day will ever contribute anything of any real world value regardless of the field.  At the end of the day, someone has to do the actual work. Chobitsu is right that its always historically been the few that have actually made any real technological progress. 



>"struggling since 1992"



If you'd take a closer look, the vast majority of the folks that were there in 1992 are not the same diversity hires that are there now in 2022. That's not even considering practical side with the massive technological leap that has happened since then.



All those "people" you constantly champion care about is just mass surveillance, virtue signaling that they work at X, and powertripping while appealing to a clique. Nothing good has come from the showing of their hand over the last decade with an artificially induced technological dark age where everything is unoptimized and overhyped garbage and any valid criticisms are censored. This corner of the internet exists for good reason.

# 14
>>15461

I agree for the most part but, the lack of resources at our disposal has a negative impact. Our collective desire for something like Chii or 2B while having great battery life does not help either. Frankly, they would need to weigh aroind 10 pounds to last 8 hours of walking speed movement with efficient motors and wheels. Then there's the problem of AI but I'm not touching that. That being said, I do honestly believe we're fine with a small team if we just work together. Like >>15463 says, there's many virtues to having a small community that champions freedom.



>rudimentary chatbot in a hobby waifu

I've suggested similar before but, we seem to be the only ones that are willing to accept a very limited waifu. The Canadian was fine with it too but, I don't share their wheelchair fetish.

# 15
>>15464

I don't consider a modular design you can constantly add to over time to be "limited". Its just a matter of time and dedication. Robots can always be upgraded and updated as budget allows.



>I've suggested similar before but, we seem to be the only ones that are willing to accept a very limited waifu. The Canadian was fine with it too but, I don't share their wheelchair fetish.



Don't think I was here for that weird story.

# 16
Well let me say right off that I appreciate all the contributions to the conversation thus far. I look forward with hope to several more from everyone, and even lurkers as well. I'd like to see us come out of all this with a solid set of plans & goals. I think that as a community, we've hashed out (or at the least addressed) most of the vitally important issues that need to be considered for this monumental task of devising DIY kits for Anon to build his own robowaifu companion. This is quite an achievement in this context as far as I'm concerned.

Rather than lump everything together into one big hairball of a post, I'll simply go down the line and make an attempt to respond to everyone's concerns, as I see things. I'm going to try to get to everything, please remind me if I missed you Anon. As I've mentioned before, I'm a **filthy** multi-poster when I'm trying to be thorough. I know some of you get annoyed by this style of posting but I ask you to be patient with me please. :^)

>I took a look at the 'Boards' page of alogs.space recently and /robowaifu/ only has 4 unique IPs. I assume these are yourself, AllieDev, Kiwi and I? 
I only post with Tor, which doesn't show up in the counts.
>Maybe sometimes we get MetaRonin and RiCo dev and a couple of other anons (ofc users could be posting under two different names). But I have checked a few months back as well, and there were just six unique IPs using the board then, too.
My rough estimate is that we get ~a dozen unique posters contribute here over the span of a month or two. IMO, this isn't too far outside the norm for niche boards in current year.

>If there are only four or five guys here intermittently I am not sure internet messageboards are the best way to approach the whole "robowaifu" concept. Don't get me wrong, they're fun...but effective? Debatable.
There's a lot wrapped up in that set of postulates and question. Rather than try to swamp you with a detailed response right off, I'll let this ride and develop my perspective on things more fully as we all go along here alright?

>I know you want to keep a small group of dedicated/autistic individuals. But there is a point where one has to consider; has the size of the group dwindled to such an extent that it will negatively impact the future progress of the engineering project? 
Apart from the big hit __everyone__ took from the redflag gayop to kill 8ch, I don't think we've dwindled, actually. Apart from our brief ''tête-à-tête'' 'debate' here a bit over a year ago, we've seen a fair amount of visitors come through. Our concern here is a very popular topic in the IB world, and we're fairly well-known by at least one Anon on practically every site out there.
>tl;dr
We have an unusually high percentage of casual lurkers for such a niche board.

>Then the next question would be; how can I increase the reach and membership of said engineering project?
We hashed out many of these points in our ''Propaganda Thread'' (>>2705), SophieDev. I don't think much has changed in the interim period. Just follow those steps would be my primary advice to you tbh.

>Personally, I would start by renaming the board to "robot girlfriends" just because that is what a lot of guys will Google search for. Many people will be completely unfamiliar with the term "waifu", never mind "robowaifu". Maybe that would increase footfall and interest? 
I'm adamant about our URI '''''/robowaifu/''''' remaining the same, but I'd be willing to change our board description from '''DIY Robot Wives''' to '''DIY Robot Girlfriends''' if most of us think it's a good adjustment.
==VOTE:==
-Should /robowaifu/'s board description be changed?

>It's a niche hobby to start with, so it needs to be as easy to find as possible for potential new recruits.
Again, a complex issue, and again, I'll hold off just now other than to agree with you that ATM, it's a niche hobby arena. In the future, I firmly believe this will become a historically-big industry.

# 18
>>15437
>There are very few unique IP's and considering I'm two of them, that's somewhat concerning.
I'd say just relax Anon, I'm sure we'll figure some things out here.

>I don't particularly mind being in a small close community but, people fill out natural niches. 
Indeed. Small community brings a clarity to that which is impossible in bigger teams. There's a ''reason'' SEALs and other elite spec-ops teams are quite small.

>I'm an industrial manufacturing engineer and very poorly suited at planning and modeling organic designs. 
Excellent. That is a tremendously important skillset to have for /robowaifu/ Anon. I'm sure you can play a major role here (even more than you have all along).

I could probably do some character modeling, rigging, etc., but quite frankly '''no one else is addressing the systems programming task yet'''. As ''Shinbo'' said in Ep 02 of ''Chobits'' '''''"Without software, they're just mannequins."''''' I know RobowaifuDev is doing some great work on AI & voice, and could in fact actually tackle this area as well, but for now AFAICT, you're stuck with us.

It will be at least two years at this pace (I'd estimate) before we have something feasibly practical to drive the kinematics of a basic robowaifu up and ready. Why not some of you other Anons here take that two-year's time and master Blender 3D Character Arts? Or Electronics? Or Structural Engineering? Or any of a dozen __''other''__ important needs? It would be a better division of labor, and tbh Kiwi should be focusing on his specialty instead.

>Moving forward, we should work on figuring out what niche we all play.
Certainly, if we were running a business or a field op, this would be very near the top of the ''TODO:'' list. It would be a significant enhancement to both our credibility and efficiency as a group to have clearly-demarcated roles and everyone filled them.

I'm willing address the concept of defining these roles as such, but I'm frankly skeptical how effective the effort might prove to be (see below).

>Chobitsu should naturally lead us, so that us few can best use our talents.
That does seem a typically-sound approach in general. Certainly for normal organizations. However, """leading""" an eclectic group of largely-autistic Anons **I'm an actual Asperger's BTW, not just a meme one** is too much for any one Anon to undertake haha. Herding cats is easier! :^)

Well, there's definitely more than 4 regular contributors here, but in general I agree about the /comfy/ aspects of it. Obviously, that's not our primary goal here, but it's a rather nice artifact all the same.
>I like not being on one of the big social media platforms.
I absolutely __will not__ participate in such. This '''''Globohomo Big-Tech/Gov''''' are the enemies of all humanity. They and their handlers have literally devised the evil that we're all dealing with--one that has created the need for /robowaifu/ to exist at all. I'm sure we'd all rather have healthy, not-actually-insane, trad wives to raise families up with. But alas, our enemies have conspired together to destroy that possibility and thus far they've succeeded. Let us see how things go for them in the end heh. :^)

>A lot of this knowledge I've gathered from looking for people interested in androids (very human-like robots, not phones you goof!). Robowaifu suffers the same problem but even more pronounced due to an even smaller interested group and even more stigma.

As a newfag shitposter in good standing, I'd suggest things are actually rather more complex than that. But I'll just cheat here a little and cut right to the chase: ''if you're overly-concerned about the opinions of others, '''then imageboards may not be your thing'''''. With all due respect, the overly-socialized leftists have themselves created the limp-wristed social conditions that our (and ''their''!) enemies have exploited. Let's not play their game shall we?

To put it another way; obviously, there is the potential for the Globohomo to literally outlaw any non-pozzed robowaifus in the future, under threat of prison **and eventually, after a couple decades of rebellion, ''death''**. How firmly do you want this Anons? Do you believe it's the right thing and that it's important? Does it really __matter__ to you what normalcattle engineers (or others) think? Isn't your dream of a loving, intelligent & helpful robowaifu worth more than avoiding embarrassments?

I'm quite forward about being a devout Christian, I've never made the slightest attempt to hide it. Now try to put yourself in my shoes for a second; How do you think I'm perceived by my Christian brethren? LOL, I can assure you the vast majority don't appreciate it! :^)

As much as I wish this could be just a fun hobby of sorts, in current year we represent a significant threat to TPTB who just __love__ the status quo. This is sea-change stuff, and a revolution is always a messy business. You actually signed up for a social war if you're serious about having your own, pozz-free, robowaifu Anon. I hope you're strapped in! :^)

There's much more I could say, but I'll hold off for now and move on.

There are issues that need to be improved, but in general I agree.

>If you'd been paying attention to the events of the last few years, you'd know that once something goes mainstream, it often gets co-opted and turned to evil very quickly. 
Absolutely this. Greed is the primary mechanism behind this corruption, but there are other influences as well. In the end, each man will be accountable for his own actions, but the simple fact is most men are too weak-willed--even effeminate!--to stand up to the evil effectively. This is all according to our enemies' plans ofc. ''Good times produce weak men'' and all. **I'll leave it to Anon to figure out what is the __'''''next'''''__ phase in the cycle heh**.

>Our community seems to have always been more like an enclave that calls to very few individuals where everyone builds their own project from what I've seen in the archives.
This will change in the future I predict. The Foundations that we--us frontiersman here on /robowaifu/--are laying will have big impacts in the future. There are and will continue to be other communities and individuals as well, for whom the light will come on and they take the robowaifu-pill.

# 22
>>15441
>I would be careful about trying to pigeonhole anons into specific roles. 
I get your point, but I also get his, Anon. It certainly would improve our odds of success as a group (and also our unit cohesion) if we all had predictable roles. We already most of us namefag here roughly for this specific process-expedient.

>As I've seen and experienced, being a jack of all trades is a far more successful approach than being extremely good in one or two fields.
Being a generalist is indeed a highly sought-after attainment in basically every field. It's also a very ''tough row to hoe''. And in __our__ case (robowaifus) I'd declare it an extremely tough one. I think specialization is both natural (as in career flow) and also inevitable.

But you certainly have a good point, and I'm striving for that goal myself! :^)

This is a reasonable scenario for now, IMO. I'd be satisfied with 30 minutes of autonomous locomotion from a full-sized robowaifu today.

Very neat! I didn't know about it, so thanks Anon. I wonder if he's aware of /robowaifu/ or not?

>So, making an open source waifu as soon as possible would be best. 
Indeed. It's a race against time in some ways for us here.

I believe this is best for now, Anon. Start small, grow big.

>I agree wholeheartedly, we have a level of security through our obscurity.
This too will change, Anon. But we can enjoy our relative obscurity for a while at least. Eventually it will be a non-issue as the entire world will be talking about home service robots **and robowaifus**.

BTW, what an actually beautiful Chii! I'm going to have to 'borrow' that one. I wonder if ''Aoki Lapis''-Anon ever stops in lately? ''Fairy-Chii'' might be to his liking as well.

As something vaguely like an engineer myself, I get the message. However, I'm ''also'' a deeply spiritual man, and (I believe) a bit of a visionary. While it's not too hard to sit back on the couch with the clicker and watch the results of the hard work of others in the media industries and say nonchalantly ''Hey, that would be neat to have a robowaifu, wouldn't it honey?'' **>tl;dr '''spends the next 3 nights sleeping on the couch'''**, and quite another to actually get up off your ass and ''apply'' yourself to devise the solutions that are needed to do so.

I feel I have no illusions about all this. This is __extremely__ difficult to solve, and will literally turn out to be ''the'' monumental engineering and design achievement of mankind. Most will hail it that 'we are now gods!'. LOL. But we ''are'' in fact, made in the image of the one true God. And, something like Him, we are all little creators. ''Pygmalion's'' dream is very much alive today, and the confluence of so many varied and complex systems and circumstances are coming to a head in human history to the degree that that '''''Galatea''''' will be walking down the streets of our cities within 2 to 3 decades. 

And I know I'm not alone in this vision & understanding, either.

>I have had to vastly reduce the scope of my project as I learned more about electronics, robotics, A.I. and it's costs, difficulty and limitations. The massive (54%) increase in energy costs currently afflicting the U.K. isn't helping me either. 
Yeah, that's a pain Anon. I'm praying for you SophieDev.

>Only having four people is a massive issue. Not trying to be negative here, just realistic. Boston Dynamics has around 300 employees, many of whom are VERY experienced and specialised full-time engineers and programmers. Yet they have been struggling since 1992 to make a bipedal robot that can function safely around humans (Atlas is not yet ready for proving ground or public trials - it still falls over a lot, and if it fell over at the wrong time/place it would badly injure or even kill a child).
>Engineered Arts, which makes entertainment robots and is much more closely aligned to what /robowaifu/ is trying to achieve has just 25 employees (unknown how many work full-time).
>But importantly, both companies have money. Boston Dynamics in particular has LOTS of money - it was recently aquired by Hyundai Motor Group for $880,000,000. Fuck me sideways with an end effector.
>Engineered Arts must at least have an annual budget within the low seven-figure range considering their payroll, business premises and the fact that their AMECA robots cost $133,000 each (as quoted by their CEO, Will Jackson) - and they have at least two AMECAs in development, along with a whole bunch of other, older (but still advanced) robots like Mesmer.
Eventually, we'll certainly need legitimate benefactors to come to our aid Anon. They'll be there, have faith and be patient. In the meantime, best position yourself today (and every day) to be ready for the flood when it comes. ''"Build on a solid foundation"'' and all that, yeah?

>If the goal of /robowaifu/ is to create an advanced humanoid robot - even a non-bipedal one (with it's own A.I. that isn't dependent upon the big-tech cloud servers like my Sophie...and is at least on-par with or better than Replika)... then we are going to need a lot more than 4 strangers over the internet sharing a library of online references and lots of wishful thinking. 
Let's all figure this out together then, shall we? The solution is out there we just need to find it.

>A shitload of cash and many connections to willing robotics/animatronics industry insiders would be a good start.
LOL, no doubt.

>Sorry if this dashes anyones hopes and dreams but when I am in serious mode, this is just how I am.
Literally not possible to dash my hopes in this matter Anon, for they aren't founded on the actions of any man **not even myself!**. Just be yourself I'd say. BTW, thanks for kicking the convo off here mate! Cheers.

That would be a paradigm shift in how the waifu would be made. Weight could go up and allow for a laptop to be used to run her software. Frankly, it would make building one go a lot faster. Only reason I don't go this route is lack of apparent interest.

>I seriously doubt 300+ "people" conspiring against each other all day will ever contribute anything of any real world value regardless of the field.  At the end of the day, someone has to do the actual work. Chobitsu is right that its always historically been the few that have actually made any real technological progress. 
>If you'd take a closer look, the vast majority of the folks that were there in 1992 are not the same diversity hires that are there now in 2022. That's not even considering practical side with the massive technological leap that has happened since then.
There's little doubt about the achievements made Anon. They are public record. Our challenge is to pull off something roughly akin, that doesn't cost an arm-and-a-leg, and that __'''''explicitly'''''__ doesn't violate the privacy rights or human dignities of Anons and other men around the planet.

>All those "people" you constantly champion
LOL. Come on Anon. He was simply pointing out the scope of these corporations. I doubt seriously he has a much higher regard for them than you or I do, yeah? :^)

>care about is just mass surveillance, virtue signaling that they work at X, and powertripping while appealing to a clique. 
We absolutely must all become experts at resisting the Globohomo intent to corrupt a man's robowaifu on him. It won't be easy, but we can certainly make things much harder/more expensive for them to pull it off.

>Frankly, they would need to weigh aroind 10 pounds to last 8 hours of walking speed movement with efficient motors and wheels. 
I do appreciate your open-eyes about the immutable laws of physics. They were designed just so for our ultimate good, actually.

Much better to man up to the horror right at the start, and then use our God-given cleverness, inventiveness, and will-to-spirit to see our goals met in the end __'''ANYWAY'''__. **It won't be easy...** :^)

>Then there's the problem of AI but I'm not touching that. 
Actually, RobowaifuDev and others are making some solid progress for us. The ability to do rudimentary understanding on commodity hobbyist hardware seems more and more reasonable daily. It's certainly an area I mean to focus on as well in the future.

>That being said, I do honestly believe we're fine with a small team if we just work together. 
Let's try to find better ways to approach this than we have thus far Anon. If you're willing, I'd like to appoint you yourself as the team lead for this investigation. You clearly already have a heart for it. It would be of great benefit to us all here if we can solve this issue effectively here and now ITT.

>Like >>15463 says, there's many virtues to having a small community that champions freedom.
This. We literally need to find a way to ingrain this latter point in every single Anon around the planet (indeed every man around the planet). How to do this I'm not sure, but at the very least it's a foundational, key tenet here for us. ''IMO, we all need to be openly hostile as a group to any attempts made here to compromise on this''.

This. It is literally just a matter of time.

And the modular design approach will prove to be a key to easily-manufacturable, inexpensive robowaifu kits. I strongly commend this paradigm for every team here. I practice it daily in my feeble software engineering attempts, but it very definitely applies to the world of atoms and economics as well.

>Don't think I was here for that weird story.
Kek. We used to have a couple of Canadians frequent the place. One of them was quite adamant about the fact we should all forego bipedal locomotion altogether as being a wasteful effort, and instead focus on wheelchair waifus. We have a thread today still championing the basic motif (>>2983). Having actually done a little homespun engineering on wheelchairs, I have to admit he has some good points.

Hopefully they'll return again, and he can continue to drive home his opus to us all. :^)

OK, let's get started in that direction I'd say. Simple as. We have to deal with the real world to make practical gains. The most majorly-buff guy in world didn't start out that way. He started lifting what he could, where he could.

Yup. Architecting good modular interfaces definitely increases the workload on the designer. I'd estimate it probably increases the intellectual load of software development by at least +50%. I expect it might be something vaguely similar for mechanics and industrial designs. IMO however, the benefits practically always far outweigh the costs involved.

We look forward to seeing your great modular design efforts AllieDev! :^)

I don't think so. This place is already the top result when I search «robot waifu» on DuckDuckGo. (But it took «"robowaifu"» to find this place on Google.) I'd chalk up the difficulty of finding this place to /robowaifu/ not being linked around often.

# 40
>>15507
You're very welcome Kiwi, and thanks for clearly defining the need and beginning the process for us of devising concrete solutions. I too look forward to the design of our software (and indeed our ''entire set of'') systems together as a team. When we start making actual physical progress, we will quickly find ourselves hard-pressed to keep up with the team-members that will want to join in & help. The real demand for robowaifus is literally beyond __any__ of our imaginations!

We are going to have to organize things here to accelerate progress though. It's understandable that our first five years were primarily individual explorations and learning adventures as we sort of all figured out together what a robowaifu means, and how to begin working towards her.

But today, five years later, I think we have many of the answers. It's time to begin focusing in on proper solutions. I'm inclined to agree with your assertion in the other thread that AllieDev's Pandora, or one of the other Reploids, is a good basic shell approach to coordinate around.

MeidoDev, Strawnon, and your's internal skeletal designs of a lightweight, rigid internal skeletal structure will be key IMO. There's a reason that the ''The Poppy Project'' has chosen the structural boxed space-frame approach that they have. It offers a good compromise of mass, rigidity, and strength all in one.

We'll need to integrate mechatronics and software into the mix as well. SophieDev's painful experiences have proven the need for simplified animation control mechanisms instead. This is one important reason I've championed learning 3D animation skills to everyone here, literally from the first month of /robowaifu/'s existence. The animation industry has already invested heavily in addressing many of these issues and generally-speaking, in far more creative ways than the typical approaches used by industrial robotics. We need to invent a brand-new, synergistic synthesis of the two here. An amalgam that works within the constraints we have before us of inexpensive DIY robowaifus.

And very hopefully RobowaifuDev's and other's efforts at AI advances on modest mobile hardware will bear fruit as well. We can conceivably utilize our RW Foundations mechanism for home server offloads of computation in a safe manner, too.

Tough challenges await us now, but we'll make if we all just '''keep moving forward''' together! :^)

Greetings and wow, a lot to read in here, I'll need to catch up. Apologies for my very conspicuous absence, had a lot going on in my life recently and I will be moving back to the east coast in about a week or so. As much as I loved the PNW, it can never be "home" for me, and while I was debating this I've had some developments. I will be necessarily vague where I must but hopefully clear overall. Idk how to say this easily and I sincerely hope you don't see this as a betrayal. I am eternally fascinated and committed to the field of AI and Robotics for more than just the Waifus and I think Robot-Human relations are something that is inevitable and should be tackled sooner rather than later (yes I'm probably stepping on a land mine here as some of you if not most are very opposed to "sentient" or "Free will" waifus). 

But I'll just drop the bomb, I met somebody and am going to be involved with a flesh and blood (but actually really amazing 1 in a million person). It could only have taken that much to distract me from what's otherwise my favorite interest/hobby. Perhaps a time traveler sent this person to keep me from creating the (waifu) Basilisk who knows? 

Either way, this doesn't really complicate things for me other than:

1. I'm going to be very busy with the move and getting situated in my new city

2. Probably not as much time, but I will visit and participate (she seems very amenable to the idea of robots/androids etc so its not like I have to hide this or be on the DL. However I am going to be working a lot extra at my job so may be here less frequently.

That being said, Chobitsu I still owe you a 1-2 paragraph summary of that long description of our major hurdles so I will get on that as soon as I have my new apartment secured and am just killing time until the move. 

Anyway - it is what it is and I just hope we can all still be cool as I don't think being without a GF should be a requirement to work on this project. If you disagree, I guess that's fair but I would hate to lose any of you over a silly thing.

That's all for now

# 42
>>15455

>Another major problem is many do not understand just how limited our technology actually is. Things like 2B and Chii are not currently possible unless you want her constantly plugged into mains power with an external computer running her neural nets on RTX cards. ...



This is correct and glaring us in the face. Before even discovering this board I had a rough concept I wanted to pilot. Basically, create our own version of the ReplikaAI app as the AI (I think GPT-2 / TalkToWaifu basically does the chat feedback, right?). Add in some routines for a type of persistent memory, context checking, spontanaity and whatever else can get away with without acquiring *too much* project creep. ReplikaAI is actually pretty decent about doing 

* yes those cringe asterisks RP emotes *

but it works and if it can be powered through our version of the AI, it can easily be translated to physical actions. * hug * and she hugs you * kiss * and she attempts to mimic that (depending on the capability of the body), etc. So the main challenge here would be a program that translates emote into subroutines/reflexes that manipulate the robotic body. 

As we are well aware, power supply issues and power delivery systems are hurdles in having self-ambulatory waifus so perhaps the starter would have to be essentially bed-ridden, sitting, and only standing with some type of support (which we can replace with "Roll" legs after a while as an intermediary, Roll legs are what I call those chunky megaman style boots, inside can be a set of perpendicular gyros and weights to lower the center of gravity and assist with stability)

Face will probably have to be like the femsapien or whatever it's called, visor with a display, or even you place your android phone sideways and when you run the app it creates the "eyes" if you can picture that for a second. Hair could probably work though.

I'll leave the "sexy bits" and how graphic you want to get with it to your imagination as there are already companies making boobs, butts, (and vag) of all shapes sizes and textures. The robot body would just have mount points for such modifications, which we could be as vague and open ended about as needed.

Anyway that's a rough idea of my "realistically feasible" waifu concept. A good starting point and goal - although the ultimate endgame is a real Chii or Dorothy or 2b - we'll get there one step at a time.

# 43
>>15472

>I'm adamant about our URI /robowaifu/ remaining the same, but I'd be willing to change our board description from DIY Robot Wives to DIY Robot Girlfriends if most of us think it's a good adjustment.

VOTE:

-Should /robowaifu/'s board description be changed?



If we're going to change it I'd change it to "companions" - I have my reasons. Wives is still fine though. If anyone is whipping up anti R/W propoganda its by pushing the pedo and "abuser" angles. Companion diffuses some of this, but so does Wife if you take it in the right way, as this implies or would imply a level of wholesomeness that offsets the "sex doll pervert" stigma that is staring us in the face. 



Also please never change Robowaifu, it's a brand at this point and remember I purchased those domain names already ; )

I've been studying design and realized that what makes a product truly successful is synergy between design and a killer app. The Walkman/iPod were successful because they were designed to allow for elegant simplicity in music playback. Nintendo's handhelds have Nintendo games and made those games easy to play on the go. So on and so forth, there's a killer app that relies on a design which facilitates easy access to that app. I originally planned for sex with your waifu to be her killer app but, that's not really something you can sell in the mainstream. So, what should be the killer app? What gets Johnny Dumbass to buy her?

I'm currently a 2. year EE student, but I've been an electronics nerd for a couple years. Have designed circuits and software for a company before i started studying.

Most important aspect for your waifu: She must be cute and portable

Welcome Gobi. Kiwi acts as team manager, so he'll be responsible for assigning you tasks. But I may say that I certainly can see benefits for us with C & AVR ASM programming. We're going to have lots of mechatronics and SBCs in our robowaifus. They'll all need custom code ofc, since we have a very specialized set of runtime requirements with our endeavor here. Some of them are '''hard real-time''', as you might imagine.

Let's see what Kiwi decides and we can go from there. I'll go ahead and create a short 'conduct' post for us soon.

Enjoy looking around the catalog Anon! :^)

Glad to have a fellow realist here. That Femisapien is apropos to my current goal as its design can scale up rather well. When you're up to it, please fill out this informative template (>>15486) and join the board waifu project. Your input is valued.

>>15519

Please join in, any input that's remotely helpful is appreciated.

>>15541

Warm welcome Gobi, your experiences will be greatly appreciated going forward. You'll naturally join me in mechanical design work and Chobitsu in the software side of things. 

>Cute and portable

Curious on how you define portable. The current design for the board waifu project is still somewhat nebulous and I would like to account for all team members desires. I'll be working on illustrations to help us determine our end goal together. For now, this board will suffice for communication though a new thread may be necessary, I'll let the team decide if we start a new thread for this project.

>Time tables, milestone goals, and collaboration

Now that we have a few people on the project, we'll begin all of that once a final design is chosen, which will hopefully be completed tomorrow.

>>15543

>Western ideal of traditional woman's work 

Cooking and cleaning are incredibly difficult tasks. I'll endeavor towards this as an end goal though the first model will only have very rudimentary capabilities.

# 50
>>15544

Great, I also think FPGAs are useful in this context with high parallelism, large amounts sensors, motors and very fast algorithms like what's needed to balance a bipedal robot need some hardware oomf to run properly.

>>15546

By portable I mean in the 40-100cm range, as that seems like a realistic and manageable size. Large robots get expensive very quickly, they require large motors, large motor controllers and a big boy battery, maybe even hydraulic power units like Boston Dynamics Atlas. There is also a much greater need for a rigid metal skeleton, like magnesium in a large robot than a small robot where you can get away with less rigid materials as the forces involved are tiny in comparison.

Small size also complicates aspects of the design, but it seems to me like cost is the largest barrier to entry and everything else is an engineering problem.

# 51
>>15546

Not Impressed. You weren't very committed to Madoka.mi or Pandora or even your very own Kiwi, and now you want to head up a new team before any actual prototypes are built.

# 52
>>15546

>>15552

I feel we need to start with some rudimentary systems engineering. This is a very complex system so we need some specifics materialized before we can make any large choices. Most important is to figure out constraints as they will determine our actual design limitations. I know documentation and SE is boring as hell and laborious, but it's a lifeline when you're working on anything more complex than a night light.

# 53
>>15550

Here's the first design image to work on. I usually work with a whiteboard so I hope this will help to communicate the basic idea for her. I used Megumin because she has a really convenient character reference sheet. I've recently figured out laptops make a cheap platform to run robotics software and charge a 3S Li-Ion battery. 

>>15552

That's fair criticism, I work best in teams so I'm confident a team will lead to success. You are free to join, what is done here can help Pandora and Kiwi.

>>15553

I agree that systems engineering and defining design limitations is important.



So far her specs are:

2 NEMA 17 steppers to lift and lower her legs

2 NEMA 17 steppers to power her differential drive

A used laptop with ROS modded to fit in her chest

Still deciding on where to place her batteries but, I'm leaning towards placing them in her boots to lower her center of gravity. 

For her controls, I was considering placing analog sticks where her nipples should be. Just feels natural.



Please add your thoughts, I tried to leave a lot of room for additions and changes.

# 54
>>15546
>Cooking and cleaning are incredibly difficult tasks.
Indeed. I'm not making a request for it ''per se'', I'm simply pointing out fact of it being an absolute  killer app for a robowaifu. Guaranteed popularity, and the first mover is often the one in the best position to capitalize on a new wave.

I wasn't thinking too clearly tbh, and frankly just being a ''companion'' for the lonely is a huge need today. The board waifu project name '''''MeidoCom/MaidCom''''' brought it out to me today. Now most individuals won't have seen ''Chobits'' and won't get the obvious reference to ''Persocom''. But they ''will' get the idea of 'housemaid/maiden __companion__''.

That may turn out to be the biggest killer app of all actually!

# 55
>>15550
Good thinking Gobi. Yes hardware is best for certain critical areas. Have you worked with any FPGAs yet, may I ask? If so, then you've done more than me with it so far! :^)

Looks like you and Kiwi will be busy doing systems design work for some time. I'll keep plugging away at my project, and hopefully by the time we're ready to begin working on the Electro/Gears hardware abstraction layers & drivers, you'll have made good progress as a team.

Cheers.

>>15559

Current actuator meta seems to be brushless motors with closed loop control. There is a project called Odrive which does exactly that, I can also recommend skyentific on youtube if you want to know more. Brushless motors and pulleys seem like the easiest way to get both power, precision and smoothness. I'm currently designing a knee joint based on this, they allow for massive flexibility with both placement of actuators and force vs. velocity tradeoffs are simply more or less pulley loops. Pulleys also have no kick back compared to normal gears, they are smooth and stiff throughout a movement and they don't jitter like servos have a tendency to do. For joint positioning I've talked to some older robotics students at my uni, and they recommend hall effect sensors in the joints. You can actually run the motors sensorless in this design and simply time the commutation based on back EMF from the motor phases with a microcontroller, inverse kinematics are calculated based on the angles of the hall effect sensors.

>>15562

Yes, we are currently doing ALU design, it's supposed to integrate with our 2. year project as a code pad for a home sec system. This is going to be difficult as I've already seen how difficult focused work is in a group you see for hours and multiple times a week.

# 57
>>15565
>Yes, we are currently doing ALU design, it's supposed to integrate with our 2. year project as a code pad for a home sec system. 
Great! We'll need to integrate similar control interfaces for robowaifus, so we can just start there.

Doing maid work will be the penultimate goal, companionship is a good starter goal.

>>15565

Closed loop brushless servos are the best actuators in terms of performance per volume and usually the most efficient if running FOC (Field Oriented Control) algorithms. The ODrive is too expensive but, the SimpleFOCShield is a great option for brushless servos. I too enjoy pulleys but, gears do have their place. Actually, open loop brushless systems perform well with gears as the play between gears provides a moment for the bEMF to act as a sensor providing location before the motor sees a spike in load. I learned that in RC forums. Closed loop using linear hall effect sensors is ideal for our application. I only suggest stepper motors because they are cheap and I have a lot of experience with them. It's a default choice as soon as power efficiency is not the primary constraint.

Thanks for the quick run down. And I can understand your frustrations as I experienced some of the same when I was project lead, someone not pulling their weight is exhausting for everyone involved and required me to step in and take over. That project was 1000x simpler than an animated robot, we even fucked ourselves over by slacking on the systems engineering which caused major headache when none of the function interfaces were clearly defined and none of the hardware block diagrams were correct. It got done when we all crunched for a week and i took an all nighter designing a state driven acceleration algorithm. Engineering is tedious work and doing it properly requires coordination and a very clearly defined plan.

# 60
>>15572

In my defense, I had no known dimensions or access to any models and the scope of the project changed constantly. Keep everything clear and consistent and we'll be fine.



Any thoughts on the current design, Chobitsu/Gobi?

# 61
>>15574

It would probably be a good idea to move this planning to a dedicated thread, it would also be wise to set up a matrix room for effective communication as IB's aren't exactly meant for fast paced conversation. 

>>15568

Chobitsu, if I remember correctly you made a design specification document? That would be a great place to start.

# 62
>>15576

My plan was to model the hardware based on the shell and I couldn't do anything past vague plans until I had your model to integrate her hardware into. Same thing with circuits, I wanted to be sure of a final design so I could spec things out and design a layout properly. Perhaps I should have been clearer about that. Also, I never had a problem with connectors, I simply was sharing information to help others. Both because I want to raise the general knowledge level of the board and, I wanted to embolden lurkers into posting. I in no way have been slacking off either way, nor have I been ignoring you. I will admit I should have been more helpful in providing you with information. Part of the problem is I assumed everyone had basic knowledge and that you didn't really need my help. If you ask directly, I'm glad to help you.

# 63
>>15577

There seems to be many options on the matrix site. I'm unfamiliar with the platform, is this correct? https://matrix.org/docs/projects/try-matrix-now/  Mind recommending a client?

>Chobitsu, if I remember correctly you made a design specification document? That would be a great place to start.
Yes, I think there is much in there that can be a help to us. It's quite spare ATM (thus the need to fill things in) but it's at least a start.

>>15582
>though I would like some input from the team on what they'd want in the initial post.
You're talented as a planner Anon **despite your claims to the contrary haha :^)**, I'm sure you'll do well. I'd say the name is the foundational key first and foremost. Figure that out properly, and the rest should follow smoothly enough.

BTW, I can always go in and edit both the subject and text of the OP. What we '''''can't''''' do however is change __any__ of the pics. So choose wisely!

>Doing maid work will be the penultimate goal, companionship is a good starter goal.
Agreed on both counts. My apologies for not seeing the obvious sooner Kiwi. Maybe Meta Ronin is right and we should rename our board description to 
>''''''DIY Robot Companions'''''

Thoughts everyone?

# 66
>>15583

>I'll give more detailed critiques later once I've time to settle in and give it a good think

I will patiently await your thoughts Chobitsu.

>Name

I think MaidCom should probably be the name as it would be more mainstream friendly but, MeidoCom is fun. :^) If the rest of the team agrees to MeidoCom I'll go with that but for now, MaidCom is the default.

>>15585

Though I understand where you and Meta Ronin are coming from and frankly, I agree that DIY Robot Companions is better, DIY Robot Wives is just nostalgic. I have conflicting feelings.

# 67
>>15585

Companions could mean anything. Its way too nebulous. 



Robowaifus are more specific and make more sense.

# 68
>>15587
>but for now, MaidCom is the default.
Agreed, for my part. You're in charge so the call is yours, obvs. I'd recommend letting everyone ITT have a say about it tbh.

>I have conflicting feelings.
Understood. I also have other reasons for reasons for not doing so I've spelled out elsewhere. But I'm willing if there's a clear consensus to.

>>15588
>>15589
try refreshing.

>>15590
>Its way too nebulous. 
Indeed. There are explicit reasons not to as well.

# 69
>>15585

Companions is probably a more apt term, it also doesn't imply directly romantic feelings which broadens the appeal to someone who just seeks companionship.

>>15582

Element is a great cross-platform client, just create a user under the matrix.org domain and log in, then you can create a room in the client. I can also do it if need be.

# 70
I think something more fast paced like matrix was what I was looking for but It just seems safer for all involved to stick to the basics of the IB.

# 76
>>15598
>You should join, Chobitsu, you're part of it too.
Thanks for the invite Gobi, but no. I'll abstain.

With all due respect to yourself and anyone else who wants to participate in such, I consider it far more beneficial for us all to use an unrestricted, publicly-accessible forum, such as this anonymous imageboard for all our work.

Not only is everything here freely available to all comers, but it's also archived as well. Not only by the site's servers themselves, but also by a small team of volunteers using various means--not least of which is our very own ''BUMP'' utility developed right here for just this purpose.

Any other alternative risks cloistering vital data inside walled-gardens, and solely under the discretion of faceless entities who have proven time and time again not to have the public's interests at heart. And very explicitly, '''''this''''' public's (to wit: Anonymous) interests at heart.

I prefer we all keep all the /robowaifu/ information safely 'locked away' fully in public view, and in the hands of free men everywhere.

So again, please keep us up to date on things, will you?

# 77
>>15602

It's end to end encrypted, so i very much doubt they have any intentions as they can't even see the data without an invitation. It's also the most open walled garden I've ever seen, the software stack is open source and you can run your own matrix server if need be, messages are decentralized. 

I assume we'll host stuff on some kind of git, sharing the link to that in a thread would be enough to follow project progress.

I can understand your position and agree on the fondness for imageboards. They just don't do real time communication very well which is why raids were always organized over IRC.

# 78
>>15604
>It's end to end encrypted, so i very much doubt they have any intentions as they can't even see the data without an invitation.
Full public visibility is actually a fundamental goal. I couldn't care much less what the globohomo does as far as accessing our data tbh. My only concern is that it remain freely available to all and sundry without restrictions. Anonymous IBs do that properly, and leave ''us''--not them--in charge of it.

>It's also the most open walled garden I've ever seen, the software stack is open source and you can run your own matrix server if need be, messages are decentralized. 
Admirable choices on their part, plainly. Now if they will lift any restrictions on anonymous viewership and posts I'd be much more inclined to be favorable to them.

>some kind of git
As with any other form of comms, anyone here is free to do as they wish. We license all our things here under the MIT (Expat), so have at it! I myself even agree to help Kiwi with push's up to a Gitlab if he chooses to run one for us.

>I can understand your position and agree on the fondness for imageboards. 
Haha. 'Fondness' is hardly the term I myself would use. They are often decrepit cesspits of degeneracy tbh! But much better that than the speshul-snowflake leftist's """alternatives""" :^)

My chief (almost ''only'', really) concern is for the welfare of men (explicitly, males) around the planet being abused by the globohomo and their cabals and golems. IBs afford some degree of resiliency in that regard hard to find elsewhere.

And the public archiving capability literally can't be beat AFAICT.

>They just don't do real time communication very well 
They certainly do when the posts are fast and furious. Trust me on this. :^)
>which is why raids were always organized over IRC.
Actually, IMO they are 'organized' on IRC ''explicitly'' b/c they are more away from the public view of normalfags & newfags. Not for some greater facility regarding post latency.

BTW, if you care to search for terms around the board, we have a utility linked ITT's OP ''Waifusearch'' that can help. Not super-capable yet, but she's fast enough.

Cheers.

Thread will be made soon, I'd like to incorporate thoughts from the team so, please offer what you'd like to see in the initial post. If Chobitsu or Gobi provided feedback on the current design, I'd be glad to add those to the thread.>>15605

# 80
>>15609
>Made a GitLab for the project
Looks good. I assume you will want code from the ''RW Foundations'' project in some fashion or other? Since our licenses differ, we'll have to maintain separate projects there if so.

>I'd like to incorporate thoughts from the team so, please offer what you'd like to see in the initial post.
Sounds good. I'll have something for you ITT very soon (~2 hrs from now).

# 81
>>15618

Yes, a RW Foundations should be added though as a separate project. It will help with clarity for them to have their own pages. Is there a benefit to the MIT license vs the GPL license? GPL seems to provide the best protection against people we disagree with from profiting off of the project. I'm new to open source and still learning.



Looking forward to your thoughts, hopefully Gobi will provide thoughts as well. Want to keep communication and team cohesion healthy.

# 82
>>15609
First off, again, I concur with the name '''''MaidCom'''''. I think it's a good one, for various reasons outlined already ITT. 

The design is great, such as it is at this early stage. 
-I'd stress the notion of explicitly allowing for modding the base kit, such as a specific set of ''Lady-bit Kits'' (>>15558, >>15563). I would very strongly urge you __'''not'''__ to fundamentally include such things in the base design, but rather intentionally to allow for such mods to be added at Anon's discretion via the 'after market' realm.
-You already have a good understanding of the fundamental physics constraints we're all dealing with. ''Square-cube law'' and all that. Having a 1 meter high robowaifu will bring along a plethora of (primarily social & legal) issues, but also brings a huge swath of engineering benefits as well. It's a reasonable place to start, but a full life-sized (145cm+) robowaifu should be the long term goal for the project IMO.
-I would suggest that the internal frame ideas sketch, while a great start so far, is just that; ''a great start so far''. Significant structural testing & redesign will be necessary as things progress, and so I'd commend you to plan for that (often drawn-out) process right here at the beginning. Scheduling time resources & whatnot. Pretty much the same for practically all the other systems involved.
-And on that note, while the Megumin character ref sheet stand-in is fine for now, I would suggest work on a custom one explicitly for the ''MaidCom'' project be started immediately. As Gobi pointed out, the systems-engineering endeavor is a vital one to the success of a complex project such as this one. A basic, and '''''fixed''''', geometric plan-out is step one for that.
-While I greatly applaud your intent to keep the steppers & actuators counts low (by all appearances), ''it's going to be a tough row to hoe''. I'm sure you're well aware of this based on your named posts on the board. I'm right there with you though, and we __must__ find clever ways to reduce our component counts of all sorts, and particularly such massive ones as sizable steppers.
-On that note, '''batteries'''. You're suggestion to place them low great increases the thrown-weight work her hips & knees must perform. I realize it's a delicate 'balancing act' **see what I did there? :^)** keeping our robowaifus upright ATP, but once we achieve full bipedalism functionality, then the pelvic ''center-of-gravity'' will the single best volume to locate as much mass as we can. For now though, if you don't intend MaidCom to lift her legs very far, then locating steppers & batteries there seems reasonable to me at this early stage.

Hope all that helps Kiwi! :^)

>For her controls, I was considering placing analog sticks where her nipples should be. Just feels natural.
Kek'd. We'll need a combo of both onboard, physical controls, and offboard, virtual ones.

P.S. Please remember that we can always go back in and edit the text of your OP. It doesn't have to be perfect yet. Cheers.

# 83
>>15620

Thanks for your input, I'll consider it when making the thread tomorrow. It's good to keep in mind that the OP can be edited.

# 84
>>15621
Y/W Kiwi. Please remember, ''these are merely suggestions, not dictates''. Please consider them as friendly advice from a trustworthy team member. As with AllieDev and the ''Pandora'' project, I'm here to help out, not direct. **I already have more than enough on my plate for that haha :^)**

# 85
>>15619
>Yes, a RW Foundations should be added though as a separate project. It will help with clarity for them to have their own pages. 
OK, as I mentioned before I'm not running the thing, you are. I'll make pushes freely which you can accept or not as you see fit.

>Is there a benefit to the MIT license vs the GPL license? 
IMO, very definitely affirmative. When I applauded your great achievement in school
>You are exactly the target 'market' for my works however, and why everything I do here is MIT-licensed. (>>14761)
I put it thus because it was apparent that you wanted to make a living creating robowaifus. Thus MIT (or, BSD). These permissive licenses directly support the creative enterprises of business. The GPL, restrictive, licenses, ''don't''. Bjarne Stroustrup (the inventor of my favorite programming language) called it "A virus against commercial use). I fully agree with him. Much as I appreciate RMS, his 'virus' isn't high on my list of favorite things tbh. I'd suggest switching to MIT or BSD 2/3, Kiwi.

>GPL seems to provide the best protection against people we disagree with from profiting off of the project. 
Fair point. I consider the issue of easy access worldwide to every.single.man. far, far, more important than whether or not bad guys (filthy commies, leftists, etc.) use our code and designs. Men '''need''' robowaifus to be in the world. Small businesses--not our hearty band of ''frontiersman adventurers'' here--will be the vital key for that future. MIT/BSD licensing supports this future outcome quite well.

>I'm new to open source and still learning.
Reminder that we have a thread explicitly on the topic Anon. (>>4451)

>Want to keep communication and team cohesion healthy.
I do too! Cheers.

>had a lot going on in my life recently and I will be moving back to the east coast in about a week or so. 
I know this feel.
>and I sincerely hope you don't see this as a betrayal.
>I met somebody and am going to be involved with a flesh and blood (but actually really amazing 1 in a million person). 
Lol, ofc no one here does Anon. I've said it before and I'll repeat it here for anyone who missed it previously.
>'''''This __isn't__ /r9k/!''''' :^)

>That being said, Chobitsu I still owe you a 1-2 paragraph summary of that long description of our major hurdles so I will get on that as soon as I have my new apartment secured and am just killing time until the move. 
Take your time Anon. You already have plenty on your plate ATM!

>Before even discovering this board I had a rough concept I wanted to pilot. Basically, create our own version of the ReplikaAI app as the AI (I think GPT-2 / TalkToWaifu basically does the chat feedback, right?).
AFAICT yes.
>Add in some routines for a type of persistent memory, context checking, spontanaity and whatever else can get away with without acquiring *too much* project creep. ReplikaAI is actually pretty decent about doing
Tall order on a shoestring budget w/ hobbyist consumer hardware, but we'll see what we can do, right?

>So the main challenge here would be a program that translates emote into subroutines/reflexes that manipulate the robotic body. 
Actually fairly straightforward to do **once the 1'001 systems support functions are properly in place heh**

>As we are well aware, power supply issues and power delivery systems are hurdles in having self-ambulatory waifus so perhaps the starter would have to be essentially bed-ridden, sitting, and only standing with some type of support (which we can replace with "Roll" legs after a while as an intermediary
It's definitely a big concern for us here.

>Face will probably have to be like the femsapien or whatever it's called, visor with a display, or even you place your android phone sideways and when you run the app it creates the "eyes" if you can picture that for a second. Hair could probably work though.
Facial is what actually fascinates me personally. I'll probably dedicate a very large percentage of my efforts there once we achieve a life-sized robowaifu.

>although the ultimate endgame is a real Chii or Dorothy or 2b - we'll get there one step at a time.
Sound wisdom, Meta Ronin.

>If we're going to change it I'd change it to "companions" - I have my reasons. 
Actually, I cast my vote 'opposed', and we're going to decline the idea as ''undecided''. **but it was close :^)** (>>15596)

>Also please never change Robowaifu, it's a brand at this point and remember I purchased those domain names already ; )
Absolutely.

Good luck on your move Meta Ronin, we hope everything works out smoothly for you two.

To add, I think these chatrooms are honestly terrible for organizing extended projects because everything gets lost too easily + room UI is always structured in a way that it makes looking at older posts a hassle (I can't imagine how much information has been buried due to discord). I'm not sure if a more real-time environment is really needed either.

Heh, I don't think that's true Anon. Kiwi and I are both interested in your threads. I'd just recommend you put your head down and focus on forward progress with your project. Once you have physical results coming together in pics, I think you'll see an uptick in interest in them. Same for __all__ of us here tbh.

Also, you might reach out to other's threads more regularly as well. Kiwi's ''MaidCom'', and my ''Sumomo's World!'' for example. There are others here too. Might help you out generally by kind of enlarging your focus to the broader issues of /robowaifu/ at large? Just an idea.

Regardless, seek for your internal motivation, remember why you're doing this, and keep moving forward.

It's an honor to have you working along with all of us here Anon. Watching your progress with your research and with your project solutions has quite frankly been inspiring to everyone. The libraries and tools you've brought to light here have been a tremendous asset to /robowaifu/, Anon. And for me personally, you've made a believer out of me that we __can__ actually pull this off on hobbyist-tier, commodity hardware. Bravo! Hard to express what that means to the overall project as a whole.

But please don't become discouraged or weary in your long efforts Anon. I think all of us face challenges as we're each progressing along the ways towards our goals. But that's the key: we're ''progressing''. Just keep moving forward. Seems like it might be sensible to you to actually make more time ''away'' from your efforts and do as you suggested in pursuing outside project work. 

Also, go waay up into the mountains for a week or so alone. Make your way over to the ocean from time-to-time. Spend more time in nature with the animals & birbs. Getting back in touch with this amazing creation God has fashioned is always highly invigorating to me personally. I come back refreshed and ready to focus, usually with a set of new insights on how to solve problems coming into my mind in very short order once I sit back down to my work.

Haha I already live in the mountains alone and just came off a break for a few months. I do get a bit weary sometimes and just want to live a simple life but I won't give up. Whenever I hit a wall I always come back to this video to refill my spirit. I made it as a joke two years ago when GPT-3 came out but it actually possible now to outperform the original design. It has been BTFO by PET with 99.9% less parameters and BTFO by human feedback and probably could also be BTFO by multimodal embeddings alone too. Combining all those techniques together is going to be certainly interesting. The only problem is they're also using many of these improvements now too so the gap between us and them is still getting bigger.



Knowing more than what we knew the moment before is only half the battle. It all comes down to putting the time in to select the right training data, create the missing data, coding better models, training them, testing them and reiterating until we get something solid.

That's the spirit RobowaifuDev! Let's all continue to inspire each other Anons.
'''NEVER GIVE UP!'''

>Whenever I hit a wall I always come back to this video to refill my spirit. I made it as a joke two years ago when GPT-3 came out
Heh, it's a classic! We have a new generation here now who may not have seen it. Even I haven't in a good while, and it's very encouraging to me. Good timing, I'm ready to jump back in and tackle some tricky problems now, so thanks for it back in fresh circulation Anon! :^)

>but it actually possible now to outperform the original design. It has been BTFO by PET with 99.9% less parameters and BTFO by human feedback and probably could also be BTFO by multimodal embeddings alone too. 
>Combining all those techniques together is going to be certainly interesting. 
Yes it is. Quite frankly, I'm pretty amazed at the rapid rate of progress happening in general with this domain. It's exciting to see, and gratifying to know that we have Anons here on /robowaifu/ taking this bull by the horns for the benefit of humanity.

>The only problem is they're also using many of these improvements now too so the gap between us and them is still getting bigger.
That's fine. They'll 'get the picture' when robowaifus as open-source, DIY kits, are available to any man to create on his own. And that will in short order translate into literally thousands of small businessmen in their garage shops & boutique factories churning them out.

''Not this time, Globohomo! '''__NO ONE F**KS WITH OUR ROBOWAIFU!!__'''''

I'm afraid I've been dormant for two years since living again with my feminist mother as her Zoom secretary (there was a time during lockdowns where seniors couldn't go out, and yes now she's triple vaxxed, feeds me soy milk, and praises George Soros and loves jews in Hollywood), she wants me to get rid of the apartment I've been using before (where I discretely store my sex doll).  So I am in no position right now to work on anything that would look anything remotely creepy that triggers the Karen instinct.  I am however learning a lot by adding single board computers to RC cars.



I came to just give a heads up that youtuber Hero Hei just cast a big spotlight on A_says_ project MaSiRo.

I was trained in C++, though nowadays I just copy and paste code blocks in Arduino IDE.  I really do admire the efforts of others to make libraries for flimsily-designed Chinese chips.



So far Ive tried wifi FPV on rc cars (doesnt work... latency is too large as the car outdrives the video feed), I am supposed to try a proper 5Ghz solution but I am procuring parts for a Jetracer instead.  And as luck would have it Shenzhen and Shanghai are locked down.

Welcome aboard Anon! Perhaps you could be RC-Dev given your use of RC cars? I think it sounds kino. For now, given your predicament, perhaps you could join as an adviser? I'm working on a swerve drive to work as a cheap mobility platform. Once finished, I'd be glad to share stl's so you could work with the platform.

# 118
Greetings again R/W team. I took a short vacation and been taking a small mental health break from everything except my job for the time being. I feel ready to ramp up again. In recent developments a link to a LiliumRobotics (not to be confused with Lillim) site was shared with me recently if we haven't already talked about that yet I'll find a place to post the link and discuss my thoughts on that. 

Also my plans for Robowaifu.link are in the works, and it's exactly what it sounds like: an index of links but this will be important later and you'll see why.

For now I'll give you this which is grossly overdue:



Name: Meta Ronin



Favorite Waifu: 2B



Specialty: Research / Info aggregation, System Analysis, Communications and Speculation/Brainstorming



Relevant Experience: at least 4 years recent Computer Science studies at three universities, AAS in Infomation Technology, Broad but Shallow range of topics including Information Theory, Discrete Math, Physics, Electronics, Chemistry, MicroProcessor Design, C programming languages, Assembly, Higher Level Languages (Python, Perl, etc) and Graphic Design  



Most Important Aspect For Your Waifu: the AI component: Turing-ready, being able to act on her own, persistent memory, ability to grow with the technology as it develops. Pipe dream but a dream is better than nothing



Desired Position On Team: Communications / Information gathering/filtering, Feasibility Testing, Conceptual Art and Design, I can be wherever is needed at a moments notice

# 119

Welcome fellow /clang/er! I used to frequent that board and their wild Fallout and Gundam art was very, inspiring. Why not fill out an intro from: >>15486?

# 120
>>15854

It's great to have you on the team Meta Ronin! I posted a link to LiliumRobotics a few weeks ago though it garnered little discussion. I was frankly startled by it at first but, his projects are little more then sex toys with cheap jerky servos bolted on that can barely move her limbs. They look impressive until they move. But, if you see something I'm missing about them that could benefit us, please do share. I appreciate your point of view.



Your diverse knowledge base and philosophically gifted mind will surely help us reach a viable waifu sooner. I believe you and Chobitsu should work on her AI together. The current plan is to develop her software on linux running on a low cost laptop. Though, your opinions on the matter would matter.



Your first assignment is to develop concept art and designs for MaidCom. Requirements being that she has a tail or some other third point of ground contact. Her feet need wheels, and she needs to balance well in common situations while remaining visually appealing. I've frankly been struggling with her design as I can't seem to nail a balance between aesthetics and general stability. 

**Feel free to make the design 2B-esque**

Based taste Madtrickster. Loving is indeed the best personality trait. You'll have the same first assignment as Meta Ronin, designing various concepts for our waifu. Do bare in mind that she must have three or more points of contact and have high static stability. With two members working on concept designs, we will find one that's viable sooner.

Thank you very much, it's a shame fallout 4 isn't a very good a game, but ada more than makes up for it, I always rush to get her assaultron body, she just looks perfect with that cute figure of hers. I look forward to making concepts and designs, I've spent so long away from my lovely robots thinking all robot love was gone, so I spent time on /monster/ for a long time, until I saw this board and I finally feel like I have my purpose again.

# 125

Welcome Anon! Glad you connected with us here on /robowaifu/. We're a SFW board generally, but ofc there's lots of crossover interest. /monster/ has a couple of **robutts** threads last I heard, and it turns out that (apparently) one of it's old denizens has rebuilt /clang/ over on 8k*n?

Anyway, we look forward to hearing from you here, I'd recommend the catalog and find something interesting to you and start a conversation. Don't worry about bumping an old thread, we don't really have anything like 'necroing' here.

I'd be happy to, Kiwi. While I don't feel very qualified to lead that conversation yet, still, I've already laid down some ideas in our framework that frankly I've never seen anywhere else. I think we have a good team here building where we can be a valuable think-tank for robowaifu development. :^)

# 132
Happy Easter /robowaifu/,



I would like to apologize for what appeared to be unnecessary censorship over the last few months.

It was not right to delete my madoka.mi thread or discourage people to help Kiwi. I was feeling insulted and excluded as I asked for help for the later half of 2021 and felt that I was excluded until I embraced the idea of reploids with some degree of success on a completely new project. Had not meant to come off as attacking any other anon and have nothing against them. The bans have since been lifted by me.



Also should have clarified that the Pandora Project was always meant to be an open board project as well and so was Madoka.mi. I deleted the madoka.mi thread because I always felt that I could make better models than what I had made in that thread as one of its project founders. I had gotten as far as installing internal components with what I felt to be such curt and minimal answers to my robotics questions and attempts at building rapport with my fellow technicians for a large part of my time here, that I did not feel like a part of a team or community at all and felt taken for granted. Perhaps weekly updates would be better instead of posting progress as often as I have would avoid this in the future.



I had also noticed another surge of coordinated trolling recently on the webring and that same pattern of shitting up every board was beginning to start here. Typically these trolls immediately start spamming threads about  politics and shilling the current big news event of the day to the extent where all cohesive discussion in threads is gone. I had also seen some of these same buzzword bingo types showing up here as of late and may have been overzealous in my attempts to help keep the board on topic.

# 133

Happy Easter to you too, AllieDev! Indeed let me add my greetings to his, and bless you all, /robowaifu/ Anons. He is Risen! :^)

Thanks for this explanation Anon, it helps. Just know that we all appreciate you being here and watching over our welfare as a board. That doesn't go unnoticed.

I hope others join in with the ''Pandora'' project as well. The more projects we have going here, the better IMO. All my efforts here are certainly open too.

Again, thanks for looking out for us all AllieDev. I hope this will be a very, very productive year for us all!

Cheers.

Happy Easter fellow waifu devs! 



To AllieDev, I hope we can consider everything as water under the bridge. I like your passion and believe that we can achieve great things. I have faith in you, same as I have faith in everyone else here. If you have questions, please do ask and if my answer seems curt, please try to be a little more specific or ask for more details. Easter is perfect for starting over. 



May god bless us all.

# 135
>>15918

Also, as mentioned in the prototype thread, any suggestions for a new name? So far I'm thinking of "Y", the name of the clock smith man who built robowaifus in Clockwork Planet.

Indeed, that's much appreciated. And yes Easter is much more appropriate a time for 'starting over' than the more traditional New Year is, for example.

Let's make this a great one! :^)

>>15921
>Also, as mentioned in the prototype thread, any suggestions for a new name? So far I'm thinking of "Y", the name of the clock smith man who built robowaifus in Clockwork Planet.
Tough decision. OFC it's entirely up to you (just please let us all know it's you haha). I think Y is pretty cool, but so ambiguous that few will get the reference I think. OTOH, maybe this is __exactly__ the right things you might want? 

Certainly no one here misconstrues you with that corporation, but I at least also recognize the importance of a good face in business. I hope you find your answers Anon, but I wouldn't rush it personally. I like '''Y''' myself, and the reference involved is truly a grand one!

# 137
A little gem I found on Easter, a paper about how to do research at the MIT AI lab from 1988. I really needed to hear the last section that talks about how to deal with failure, how to get unstuck, how to avoid insecurity, maintain self-esteem, and have fun in the process.



>>15915

It's understandable. Making a robowaifu is an immense task and each subtask requires great devotion working long hours to accomplish anything, whether it's 3D modelling, mechanical engineering, robotics, manufacturing, AI or anything else. It's really bitter when you put so much effort in and people don't appreciate it or have much to say or flat out just criticize it.



I've noticed a lot of us including myself are hyperfocused on one or two topics and not really meshing together. I've been trying to be better but I think it's a natural consequence of how small the board is and our specific interests. At the end of the day though the main reason I'm here is to make a robowaifu and I see that each of us are tackling that dream in various ways one problem at a time. Things don't go the way I want them but as a whole we're going in the right direction and that's what counts.



In three years we'll look back and laugh at our past selves and the shenanigans we got into and then marvel at how much progress we made, because three years ago robowaifus were just a twinkling fantasy in /robowaifu/'s eyes and now look how many projects there are.

You turn her on, show her how to do something and she does it. No confusing code or manuals necessary to operate, even her maintenance is built-in. As a maid robo she works diligently for you. Some might use her abilities to clean and play games, some might employ them as part of company or an assistant in freelancing. I think it's feasible to achieve within 5-15 years. We just have to start with minimum viable products, iterate and integrate.



My MVP right now is getting cutting-edge AI tech working on older hardware and Raspberry Pis. From there I can make virtual waifu software that downloads and just werks and then expand into robowaifus. Although all my work is open-source I plan to fund my operations by building and selling standalone products, like offering Raspberry Pis preloaded with all my waifu software fully-configured, maybe even customized, so people with no programming knowledge can have their own mobile virtual waifu to chat with at all times and ask to do things like search or play games together.



Eventually I see creating a new economic ecosystem where people can provide their services for training AI models to perform new functions, manufacturing and designing custom clothes, parts, faces and bodies, prefab kits people can put together or that come pre-assembled, offer maintenance and repair kits, etc. People create products and services to make money, regular people get the stuff they want, open-source draws in new developers and opportunities to make money from scratch, more robowaifus get produced, manufacture at scale reduces production costs, competition improves the quality. It's a 360 win for everybody.

Absolutely based taste, glad to have you.



You'll be joining Chobitsu on the software side of things. Not sure how much you've read of the previous posts related to MaidCom but, the current plan is to use a low cost laptop running linux (ROS/Ubuntu). So, your efforts to get AI running well on low power hardware is perfect for the project. 



Your first paragraph reminds me of the "teachable/trainable" robots that can be programmed by pressing a button, then physically leading the arm through the motions, then pressing the button again. I actually had to program an arm at an assembly line to work that way by converting sensor readings to G-Code and using a program to type it into the G-Code environment. It was really convoluted but, perhaps something like that which uses AI detection as variables could work? 



>Industry around AIs, mods, and reapir kits for waifus

MaidCom will lead to this industry. Glad to have you thinking of the business aspect of it already.



Looking forward to working with you in the MaidCom thread, I'll be posting some details related to her mechanics before the end of the week.

Maybe a dumb question (I know nothing about robotics), but why do Hollywood and Disney churn out more realistic robots than the "actual" robotics industry?

# 146
>>15962
Hello Anon, no that's not dumb at all. I claim no expertise regarding your question per se, but IMO there's probably a couple of reasons, at least.
1. Budget
2. Reality

The first one is simply that they have very deep pockets to send towards a given project. They can employ literally hundreds of skilled artisans and engineers towards solving tricky problems. Disney in particular has been investing literally billions of dollars US over many decades at hiring and funding bright men to solving myriads of different problems in the animatronics-based ''Creature EFX'' industry. 

The Hollywood system is also very nomadic as well. Not only are there dozens of top studios, but there are hundreds of smaller ones. Spread that out worldwide, and you probably have at least 20'000 studios producing film for the cinema industry at large. The men that do their specialties flow in and out of these studios, and there's generally a pretty rapid dissemination of insider tips & tricks going on; NDAs notwithstanding. 

It's a fun industry in several ways, and a much, much larger group of men are clamoring to get their foot in the door with it. This fact allows the studios to stretch these massive budgets out in ways hard to believe. Just read the credits reel on any major blockbuster film today. Usually it's in the several thousands.

===

The second one is simply that they don't have to face 'reality' with their craft. These showcase robots are part of a dog-and-pony operation designed to do one thing: '''look good on film'''. I might also add that 3D CGI -- even in Creature EFX -- has become practically indistinguishable from reality today. Throw enough resources at a given shot, and eventually even an expert not involved in the production itself is likely to be fooled by it. Basically you may ''not'' be looking at an actual practical animatronic robot, even if you're convinced you are. And mockups are often roto'd and comped with CGI on the plates as well **(they spent 9'001 hours in MS Paint on each frame of film :^)**

There's one prevailing opus across the industry, ''"If it looks good, it __is__ good!"''

Hope that helps Anon. Cheers.

Excellent analysis Chobitsu, though I would add that films are making expensive disposable one-offs. Robotics projects like ours need to be easily replicatable and extensible. There's a mammoth difference between one specialized machine that's used then discarded and waifus for everyone, that will be loved and cherished. Though, budget and man hours do make up most of the difference.

Disney does animatronics for their parks which are actually more important than their movie business. Other people in robotics might even not recognize this as a field of robotics, and are completely focused on other things. There are actually barely any reasons to build very human-like robots.

  

Disney Research Hub; https://www.youtube.com/user/DisneyResearchHub

# 152
>>15982
Yep, Disney and their ''Imagineers'' have done a remarkable array of work in both their film & theme park divisions, notably for our concerns the animatronics work in their ''Creature EFX'' subdivision I mentioned, and their ''Dark Rides'' subdivision that you mention.
>There are actually barely any reasons to build very human-like robots.
Heh, I think there may be a few 100 thousands anons who'd like a word with you. :^)

The 2 cents of a casual observer:



TL;DR - We need the "RPG Maker" of waifu bots



I think this board needs a "retard-friendly" waifu-bot, or some kind of settled-on standard that's customizable by someone without lots of technical experience.

Most of the designs I see are for "full-stack" people: you have to build everything from the ground up, so you need to know many subjects at once to start improving stuff. Even if you steal someone else's design, you still need to do a bunch of 3d printing and assembly (a skillset of its own) to get a robot at all, much less start customizing its behavior.

This is terrible if you want to build up a community of interested hobbyists who don't have the time to master multiple skillsets.

Therefore, I think the best use of labor would be settling on a single, customizable, open-source design.

The hardware would be focused on "simple and reliable" instead of "innovative and complex" to keep engineering costs/time down.  It could even be as crude as a car with a screen, because the point is to provide a canvas for the here and now to build upon and update later. It should also have a simulated counterpart for people who don't want to actually build the thing.

The software would be focused on simplifying the customization process for the end user. ROS or some other complex tool can be employed in the back end, but developers should be able to customize the robot's behavior with a simple-to-use scripting API, perhaps something in python. A standard interface will make it easy to connect chatbot programs, TTS engines, remote control input systems, etc. to the robot. It will be less powerful than being intimately familiar with ROS, but having an easy-to-understand, well-documented just-werks system would bring a lot more people into the community (artists, hobbyist programmers, etc.). *

A programmer could work on improved object recognition, an artist works on new waifu bits, and an engineer works on better hardware design, all independently of each other. This takes much greater advantage of open-source and the internet than relying on lone titans making everything from scratch.



*(If anyone's interested, I can elaborate further on how the software would work)

Spreading the very idea of robowaifus out to the four corners of the Earth is our prime agenda, and our numerous goals certainly include making their creation,construction, development, and manufacture accessible by any reasonably-competent, well-motivated, man who cares to create one **hundred** for himself. :^)

Everything you've decribed is part of the MaidCom project aside from cars with screens. Though, I'm unsure how you'd build a wwaifu without 3D printing. Would papercraft work? I'd be wiling to make a paper version of MaidCom available if 3D printing really is that big of barrier to entry. Though as I've mentioned to Chobitsu previously, it's actually pretty difficult and rather delicate. Your voice and concerns are valued, please join the MaidCom project Anon.

# 156
>>16064

From the "front end", the developer would just need to know a very simple API to command the robot and link it to other programs. All the stuff that directly interfaces with the hardware is handled in the "back end" behind the API.



Example:

```cpp


#Make the robot speak



import SomeTTS from FooLibrary



WaifuBot.Sound.PlayStream( SomeTTS.Speak("Sneed") )



#Autonomous movement



Import FooSLAM



CameraArray[] = WaifuBot.Camera.GetAllStreams()



FooSLAM.CameraInit(CameraArray)



Waifubot.Movement.AutoMove(FooSLAM.Commands())

```



and so forth.



The back-end would be comprised of independent modules that interface with the hardware.

The face-screen and lighting are controlled by the Expression module, wheels/motors controlled by the Movement module, etc. Each module is customized to the robot's hardware, so the front-end dev doesn't have to worry about whether it's using wheels or legs. He just types "Waifu.Move.Forward(10 meters)"



This results in front-end scripts that can work on many styles of robots, and be easily modified.



>>16065

>without 3D printing

I'm not saying we should do away with 3d printing, I'm saying that devs shouldn't have to build the robot to make software for it or test their programs out. 

If everything goes through a simple API, then you could make a "dummy" robot (a program that takes in API commands and generates fake outputs) to test/debug your software.



>please join the MaidCom project

I'm not sure where I would start. I don't have experience with ROS or CAD.

# 157
>>16066

So, a virtualized waifu that can be programmed via a simple to use interface? I can see how that would be appealing as something to have before one could build her 3D body. Your thoughts can provide valuable guidance and a unique point of view that aid development. I wouldn't mind a 2D avatar of my waifu living in the wired when she's not in her 3D body, like Ritsu.

# 158
>>16067

>virtualized waifu

Not exactly. I was thinking more a program that would return data as if it were connected to a robot.

Say you wanted to test a program that takes in video feeds. If you send the "Show me video feeds" command to the virtual robot, it returns a fake/pre-recorded video feed so you can test that your program is working.



But, if it's all using the same API, you could make a 2D/3D virtual waifu running the same scripts, too.



Maybe what I'm thinking of isn't a particular waifu design, but consolidated API that can be re-used for different waifu projects. If everyone uses the same API for things like speech or AI, then one AI engine can be used for different robot projects instead of everyone rolling their own solution.

Think a REST API but for Waifus and not webapps.

The idea of moving down there to Orlando and getting a in or tangential to animatronics to be learning something useful relating to our project here had crossed my mind. Or even innovating something that Disney buys the patent for. Far fetched but I hard not to imagine that advances in one could benefit the other. I still think it helps to be immersed in the environment, if you want to build robots be where the robot builders are, etc.

I like this idea. Its easy to procrastinate if we are just submitting randomly versus expected weekly updates (this was a simple way I'd managed projects in the past, knowing I would have to give an update once a week would get me into action)

>I had also noticed another surge of coordinated trolling recently on the webring and that same pattern of shitting up every board was beginning to start here. Typically these trolls immediately start spamming threads about  politics and shilling the current big news event of the day to the extent where all cohesive discussion in threads is gone. I had also seen some of these same buzzword bingo types showing up here as of late and may have been overzealous in my attempts to help keep the board on topic.

Yea, I've mentioned this before, thought I might have been a bit paranoid but if others are seeing it too, then maybe not.

I really like your ideas and your diagrams Anon. You plainly could be a big help to everyone with our documentation problems here. For instance, with the ''Robowaifu Design Document'' (>>3001).

>From the "front end", the developer would just need to know a very simple API to command the robot and link it to other programs.
>Example:

>''< insert proposed pythonic waifubot code examples here>''

>and so forth.
Why not join with me, and help us devise the protocol framework you suggest Anon? We certainly could use your help, and our robowaifus could definitely do with having some kind of Python API, exactly as you suggest they could. I've not needed to master Python myself, and need lots of help with it tbh. 

>All the stuff that directly interfaces with the hardware is handled in the "back end" behind the API.
We can use a subset of Boost or some other library to help us out with the mechanics of exposing our code as Python API calls.

>''Expression module''
>''Movement module''
For consistency's sake, we would want to keep the naming across languages (ie, C/C++/Python) consistent. Please have a look at our latest codes in the ''RW Foundations'' thread (>>14409, ...) for some examples already in place. Constructive criticisms are always welcome, and a dialog about an API way back in it's beginning (ie, **Today**) is the perfect time to hash everything out thoroughly.

So, again, please do consider joining our team and being a more productive part of things here on /robowaifu/ Anon. We're all quite swamped with the task ahead and certainly need the assistance.

I know this is super old, but a while back and somewhat semi recently finding the "right" robo waifu can be hard to find.

I use to advertise this board at the local uni and some other places and men who tinker in robotics as a hobby, but some search engines have a very shady site if you search for "robowaifu".

The "Гунтretort" address in partic redirects to shady sites, and for any random people that aren't ready for it, who knows what it's trying to redirect to...



I only recently started looking for this place again to see what was going.

I also know of a small group of around 7 probably over a year ago that stopped lurking/posting over the comment deletions concerning that one dev with the animated wall paper thing he was trying to sell.



>>15915

> I had also noticed another surge of coordinated trolling recently on the webring and that same pattern of shitting up every board was beginning to start here.

Is this why the site was down?

Too little moderation and people say it's bad, but I think far too much moderation is worse, but I wasn't here so idk what happened.

Often I will link this site (back when I had the right site address) from other places that are often coming from political arguments of "no one is working on such robowaifus" and thus I directed them here...

Idk if that resulted in trolls or not...



This place kinds of scares me sometimes, because I don't really know who is running it, and who is watching.



Aside from that, hopefully before the economy crashes I was planning on releasing an offline capable "robowaifu" RPG game for android (for mobile) and linux (for pc). And browser based versions for all other OSs.

The idea hopefully wasn't the "disagreeable" companionbot software that it seems some are weary of, but the idea was just to get funding.

The game itself was going to be as generic as most other generic RPGs, but when you make a character it is going to be your custom "robowaifu" as you can use her for talking or for playing inside the game. The gist of the game is just building and upgrading your girl you made.

Ultimately I wanted to redirect players to this (robowaifu) site to build their "girl's" actual mechanical body.



My idea to disperse the funding was by setting up a system/site where the collective player base can fund very specific goals/work to be done that is contracted. (So that there is no scam crowdsourcing nonsense)



Although I must say, it does seem like there is a possibility there may be a global ban on robotics if a ww3 starts to play out.

So it seems now there truly is a deadline...

Glad you're back Anon! :^)

>I also know of a small group of around 7 probably over a year ago that stopped lurking/posting over the comment deletions concerning that one dev with the animated wall paper thing he was trying to sell.
Not surprising I suppose. Certainly, I bent waaay over backwards to try and keep from having to delete Em Elle E's thread. After all, a whole lot of us put metric-effing-boatloads of thought and conversation into that thread! But he insisted on it. It was extremely rude of him, so I gave him a year ban (well, sort of), and deleted all his own posts (again, at his insistence) & archived the remainder of the thread for the rest of us.

It can still be read today, ofc. (>>10362, ...)

>This place kinds of scares me sometimes, 
Lol, that bad ehh? 

>because I don't really know who is running it, 
I am. I both began the /wbg/ (Waifubot General) threads back on 4cuck/g/, was generally the primary ringleader and (often as not) led the discussions all across the Internet about robowaifus back in the day. I founded the /robowaifu/ board itself back on 8chan/8ch some 5.5 years ago now. I rescued it from destruction (by the glownigger redflag gayop clearly intended to destroy the free Internet), and I'm also the current BO of it. 

I started it because feminism has literally destroyed both the civilization I so cherish, and also (often quite literally) the lives of millions of men abused thus. Robowaifus (so long as they obtain the quality we all dream of) will go a powerful-long way towards righting the tremendous set of wrongs done to our society -- indeed to our civilization -- by TPTB. ''Cute anime catgrill meidos in tiny miniskirts'' will be a '''__God-sent blessing__''' to us all if I manage to have anything to say in the matter!! :^)

My fingerprints are all over it. More info can be found in this post (>>14500). AMA, Anon.

>and who is watching.
LOL. __EVERYONE__ is watching, fren!111 :^) We have both friends and enemies all keeping an eye on the place. 

And in the future, when a man can freely make the waifu companion he desires in the comfort and privacy of his own home -- and relatively-easily too (open-sauce, tutorials here & elsewhere, etc.) -- then you can bet the scrutiny both pro & con will explode in scope. As in: '''''a global phenomenon big'''''.

Good enough?

>I was planning on releasing an offline capable "robowaifu" RPG game
Sounds great, get to work Anon! I'm sure it would be of interest to us here.

>and thus I directed them here...
>Ultimately I wanted to redirect players to this (robowaifu) site to build their "girl's" actual mechanical body.
I think you should team up with our long-time regular Meta Ronin, then. He desires to create various online presences for robowaifus generally, and together you two might do something important. Just an idea, and you also might look into our ''Propaganda Thread'' too Anon (>>2705).

I have access to higher tech than commonly known so we can potentially have near limitless run time, that's not an issue for me and if you believe in this then you can have it too before most others.



The atoms keep on going and going, ever wonder why?

The heart also could keep going seemingly forever if maintained properly and allowed to do its thing.

So too can electric power be continually generated and I have seen magnets used for this, it is very real.

It can be as small or as big as needed.

The thing I've had most trouble with is tiny yet strong actuators. Maybe we could mimic how the body does it...

...small animals like rats and birds can move so it should be possible, its just that we need to mimic that with electronics and engineering in some way.



I'm still kind of stumped on that.



I wont give up, but sometimes I take breaks for various reasons. I have other projects too that I work on and which help hone my skills.

>Atomic motion

Every atom can be considered a thermal engine powering the motion of electrons. I'm grossly oversimplifying as nuclear physics at this level is of little benefit to us.

>Heart

Surprisingly inefficient, requires a lot of energy from ATP that the body produces through several chemical cycles reliant on the intake of caloric foods.

>Continual electric power via magnets

Well, most generators do function via alternating magnetic fields on a conductor to induce an electric field. Please provide more details, is this related to the previous energy examples? Perhaps a generator based on burning a caloric fuel, like alcohol? I've been thinking about alcohol powered stirling engine, though its low power to mass is a concern.

It can be of relevance, the atoms are self perpetuating is the point.

>Heart

Its actually very efficient as is the body when managed right. Its evidenced as how difficult it is for us to make advanced robowaifus, nature truly is magnificent. Also the point I'm making is that the heart is self perpetuating as long as sustained by the will of the body.

>Perhaps a generator based on burning a caloric fuel, like alcohol?

No, the "fuel" is the magnets which are actually made when the electrons of atoms align in such a way that they create a current within the magnetic material (which is what makes a magnet work) Any and all electric currents make magnetic fields, and because the atoms are self sustaining, the magnetic field which is generated from the atomic alignment in the permanent magnet can be used to make a perpetual power source. I have personally witnessed such a device work, but its still being tested and not quite ready for release yet.

>Have you considered making her larger than a fairy?

I have considered a lot of things, I do think there's a way to do this, making a smaller robowaifu means less materials, but more intricacy, which is a challenge I'm interested in.

Unix manuals, C programming and proper C practices and techniques, portability between hardware/software platforms and C libraries, Unix utilities, library design and implementation, automated testing, automated releases, linting/checking (haven't done fuzzing yet), build systems, spotting/fixing violations of the C and POSIX standards because I've read large parts of both standards several times specifically so I can memorize them and become a language lawyer, and whatever else doesn't come to mind.



>Relevant Experience: 

The specialties are the things I'm good at, there are more things I know but suck at. I'm not good with GDB or at reading other people's programs for instance. I can write a Windows installer, but I don't think I do it well, and quite frankly I only did it as a challenge–I don't want to deal with Windows' awfulness.



It seems I find a bug in everything I touch. I've found bugs in a build system, a compiler, multiple libcs, a kernel, an irc client, and numerous other programs I use merely by using them. I also found bugs on many I don't use. Usually I try to fix the bug and send the patch, otherwise I only report it, for instance I had no idea where to even begin with fixing that compiler bug so I only reported it.



I'm the main author of a popular FLOSS program, not because I wrote it, but because I hacked on it until most of the source was of my authorship. I deleted half the C code and over 90% of the build definitions, ported it to all the free unix systems and some more, fixed bugs, implemented superior practices, rewrote the entire documentation, and rewrote needlessly complicated and obtuse code with a fraction of the lines of code.



I've ported numerous programs and written many manuals at this point. I've rewritten code faster/simpler/smaller in many projects.



I basically write entire projects alone and I follow every good practice I find. I find that some professional programmers for instance only really know what their job requires of them. One guy is a good algorithms developer and writes all the algorithms, but doesn't know how to write a man page or only export the API symbols of a library. Another can very easily and quickly dive into source code, understand it, and begin maintaining it, but has no idea how to keep the Windows or the Haiku port working and if there's a merge conflict he asks someone else to do it. 

Well, I'm a homegrown Unix hacker, I'm all alone doing all parts of the program and nobody helps me fix what I don't know because nobody uses my original programs, so I've had to learn everything and I had to learn to do it properly to avoid wasting my own time with low quality tools and brittle code.



My experience with programming begins around 10 years ago when I first installed Linux and became obsessed with the command line, I learned Shell, sed, and AWK. A little over 2 years ago I read through K&R C and did quite a few of the exercises (there are a lot of hard exercises there that I didn't manage) and since then I have worked through programming books almost daily. When I get bored, I go write some program or contribute to FLOSS. I've always tried to keep progressing by diving into something I've never done before, in just 2 years I find I've done quite a lot, although I only went deep into my specialties.

None. I don't like responsibilities. If you write a C program, I'll review it and send fixes and suggestions. I can also help with documentation, those Unix small languages like Shell, writing packages for Linux distros, and whatever else I might know.

Welcome aboard the project Nagisa! From what you have written of yourself, you'll be very valuable  on the software end of things. Naturally, we won't put any pressure on you though you seem to be quite the expert. I'd appreciate your thoughts on running a ROS container in Alpine Linux communicating with an Arduino to control the motors, read sensor values, and communicate with I2C devices as needed. That is the current plan for her system, your feedback would be valued, please post it in the MaidCom thread.

You're talking to one of very few who truly understand where you're coming from. **I dream of oni snu snu** You'll find in the thread that we're focusing on a 100cm tall version first but, 190cm can be added as a goal after the 150cm version. **Will be difficult to pull off because physics but, engineering can solve anything.**

ROS has a lot of "documentation" but it actually says very little. I only found the source code because I looked at the Ubuntu compilation instructions which suggested adding a source repository to Ubuntu and the repository was hosted on Github.

I'm wary of that organization.





I jumped on the source code of one of their C projects and I see a load of useless wrappers around stdlib functions https://github.com/ros2/rcutils/blob/master/src/strcasecmp.c https://github.com/ros2/rcutils/blob/master/src/strdup.c

Every line of code has a cost, adding lines of code to add argument checking to the callee isn't worth it. Programmers will have to lose time learning those wrappers, using them will tie programs to ROS, and they don't actually provide any benefit: you still have an error you have to check if you pass null pointers to those stdlib wrappers.

The other thing that code does is let the caller specify the memory allocator. I doubt they found an use for a custom memory allocator in their stdlib wrappers. Most likely they're just losing memory and performance by adding more parameters and layers of pointers to dereference to functions.



If you check at the callee, you still have to check at the caller, because then you have to check if the callee returned error. Worse, the errors are only going to pile up, and you'll have to come up with increasingly complex mechanisms to signal what kind of error happened. As errors from one part of the program are propagated to increasingly distant places, it will become impossible to handle them. If there is no way to signal what kind of error happened as is the case here, error checking paradoxically becomes impossible because someone added error checking to a function.



If you check at the caller, the callee doesn't have to check anything, and every function it passes the argument to doesn't have to do any checking either. The errors aren't allowed to snowball, keeping error checking to a minimum, and errors are only checked where they might be acquired, keeping them close to their source. All of this without letting any error go unchecked. This is also way less lines of code, so it results in less code to maintain, smaller binaries, and less chances of bugs cropping up because you can't have bugs if you don't have code.

Errors should be checked where they might be acquired. 



Also, type names ending with _t are reserved by POSIX: creating one such type is UB, though it's unlikely to cause trouble.

And this memcpy call https://github.com/ros2/rcutils/blob/master/src/strdup.c#L52 copies 1 extra byte unnecessarily.



I would send patches to remove all that stuff to them but I doubt they'd accept the patches. Someone decided that poor design was the design for him.

I'm new here, though I have been lurking for quite some time.



This animated webring button hilariously eats a good portion of my old CPU, I had to zap it with uBlock.



Anyway, nice board, I really like the devotion and higher level of discussion here.
