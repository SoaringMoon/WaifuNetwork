ITT: We discuss Metamaterials, Self Organizing Systems, and other "outside of the box" tech (flexible PCBs, Liquid Battery, etc) 

I'll start with this video on self-assembling wires, and will add more as I come across it

Interesting thread topic, OP.

So, anon posted some great videos from the guy who runs ''The Robot Studio'' (>>9357, >>9470) , and watching these I wondered if strain sensors could sort of be embedded directly within the elements that appear to be serving primarily as elastomeric 'shock absorbers/returns'.

I reckon there are many parts of a robowaifu that we'd like to stay flexible and soft, yet still serve in a meta-capacity like a sensor, containment vessel, airflow portal, etc.

Amazing. It's like watching a lightning bolt form in ultra-slow motion.

I wonder if neuroplasticity in the brain does something like this to form new connections? Although the voltages it works with are only millivolts. It'd be interesting to see this experiment carried out on a micron scale with lower voltages.

maybe not cutting edge but Lithium Ion batteries have a trajectory favorable to our purpose here. I'm also very enthused about the concept of liquid battery (which can run through flexible tubes)

>Solid-state batteries feature significant capacity for energy storage, but they typically encounter numerous problems that cause them to degrade over time and become less efficient. Liquid-state batteries can deliver energy more efficiently, without the long-term decay of sold-state devices, but they either fall short on high energy demands or require significant resources to constantly heat the electrodes and keep them molten.



>The metallic electrodes in the team's battery can remain liquefied at a temperature of 20 degrees Celsius (68 degrees Fahrenheit), the lowest operating temperature ever recorded for a liquid-metal battery, according to the researchers. This represents a major change, because current liquid-metal batteries must be kept at temperatures above 240 degrees Celsius.

Very nice information there Anon, thanks.

Internal repair robots for our robowaifus, at some point?
>MIT engineers have discovered a new way of generating electricity using tiny carbon particles that can create a current simply by interacting with liquid surrounding them. ...
>To harness this special capability, the researchers created electricity-generating particles by grinding up carbon nanotubes and forming them into a sheet of paper-like material. One side of each sheet was coated with a Teflon-like polymer, and the researchers then cut out small particles, which can be any shape or size. For this study, they made particles that were 250 microns by 250 microns.
>When these particles are submerged in an organic solvent such as acetonitrile, the solvent adheres to the uncoated surface of the particles and begins pulling electrons out of them.

Yes, I've thought occasionally about issues involving automated repairs of our robowaifus. It would definitely be a very high-end feature during the first years, but it would certainly be a tremendous facility to have in place.

Just imagine how nice it would be if our vehicles and other complex machines could do their own maintenance. Same for robowaifus.

A simpler version or alternative to this are robots which are using magnetic fields outside of their body. Didn't watch the vids I link here right now, but something about it another day: https://youtu.be/N7lXymxsdhw

There's much more on this on YT if one looks for 'microrobots megnetic fields'. However, this is not very pressing, so it might be a needless distraction (for which I tend to fall very often). Just wanted to mention it, so we have it on the radar.

>Just wanted to mention it, so we have it on the radar.
Fair enough. Always good to plan ahead. And honestly, I've certainly left my fair share of 'notes' behind here on the board. Being a sort of information repository of robowaifus is actually quite valuable I think.

I haven't been adding to this thread in a while, but I found something today that fits the bill

That is a very cool idea Meta Ronin. I imagine we can actually find some usages for that with the structural elements inside our robowaifus.
