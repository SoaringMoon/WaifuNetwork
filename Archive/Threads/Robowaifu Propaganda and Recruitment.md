Attention drawfags and writefags!  Your skills will be needed.
   The task of building and designing a robowaifu is a herculean quest.  As great as this community is, /robowaifu/ simply does not have the manpower to real our goal of DIY robowaifus.  Luckily for us there are several communities on the internet that we could find new recruits or allies to help us build our waifus:

MGTOW - These guys know all about the legal pitfalls of marriage and the dangers of feminism.  There is already a lot of talk about sex robots in MGTOW communities.  It shouldn't be a hard sell to get them to come here.

Incels - Guys that can't get laid.  The opportunity for love and companionship should be enough to bring some of these guys over.  We need to be careful when recruiting from some of their communities.  We don't want to attract negative attention.

Monster girls/furry/mlp fandoms - The only way these guys are going to be able to have their harpy/elf/goblin/anthro/pony/whatever gf is with a robowaifu.  They have an interest in seeing us succeed.  Again we need to be careful here not to attract the wrong kind of people that will bring us the wrong kind of attention.

Male STEM students - Generally these guys aren't going to get laid until after they have established themselves.  A robowaifu could really help them.  This may be a harder sell because many of them have been brainwashed in university, but they have skills that we could really use.

Transhumanists/biohackers - Many of the technologies involved in building a robowaifu could be used in transhumanist or biohacking applications such as building an avatar.  They may have some interest in helping us out.  We will need to be careful which transhumanist communities we go after as many of them are full of feminism, tumblr tier sexualities and genders, and SJW's.

Cyberpunks and technophiles - These guys (and they are usually guys) are all around into technology and may just enjoy working on the kinds of projects we need to do.  They are often into programming and AI.

Great poster idea, and a very good introductory breakdown analysis of the target groups you mentioned. There are some real distinctions there that I hadn't taken into account tbh. 

Good job highlighting the cautionary notes. Sadly negative consequences are part-and-parcel of being in this fight that has been laid on us. 'Negative attention' will simply be unavoidable. It only takes one side to start a fight ofc, and you fight when the need arises. 

I'd say just use the wisdom you're already displaying and then proceed as you see fit. On my end I'll work to make sure /robowaifu/ keeps it's nose clean, and I will put the bad guys into the timeout corner as needed. I expect Robi himself will also stand in our corner regarding any assaults against us on that front. He's already demonstrated a lot of fortitude concerning /delicious/, for example. He's also a rather clever guy, and so I'm sure we can go to him for help should the need arise.

You just do your part Anon, and we'll do the same. Onward! :^)

Do you have some specific goals in mind OP? What are your next plans with this now?

# 3
It may be wise to target imageboard communities first so we don't have to integrate a bunch of newfags into our culture while we are so small.

# 4
>>2709
Seems a reasonable idea, I think I'd agree with this Anon.

# 5
Ok, I guess you might be able to call me a writefag. I am also a newfag to programming and this board in general I feel that we need some psychology threads and in those to discuss things like the included pictures, but also what changes we would make to make our individual version of our waifu. I get that programming is important and more important probably, but you need to know WHAT you want your waifu's small mannerisms and such to be. Pretty much another part of this whole robowaifu thing. And not everyone is an artfag or writefag. But there has to be certain things that attracted you to a character to the point you want to make a robowaifu of them? I think opening up to certain creative communites could be helpful at some point if done right.

I got Seiken Densetsu 3 working in OpenAI retro gym. I'm going to try integrating two player once I finish implementing my learning algorithm and semi-supervised learning so I can take control and guide it when it gets stuck. It's also possible to record inputs so perhaps if /v/'s interested in playing with it they can upload their session data and contribute training data towards creating AI waifus that can play video games.

# 7
>>2711
>[and] I feel that we need some psychology threads
Absolutely. Please do so. 
>But there has to be certain things that attracted you to a character to the point you want to make a robowaifu of them?
Great question and definitely would be a good thread idea.
>I think opening up to certain creative communites could be helpful at some point if done right.
Fair enough. But I can warn you ahead of time that pandering to 'fee-fees' will not get a lot of approval, nor sympathy on IB culture in general, and rightly so IMO. ''Female-driven psychology'' is one of the important reasons most of us congregate on IBs in the first place to get ''away'' from that stuff. Some of the leading-questions in the documents you shared are in fact examples of what I'm talking about.

But very much yes, Character's Psychology is an important topic in both stories, games, & film. It has very obvious importance to us here on /robowaifu/. Let's just try to keep it out of the SJW-esque cesspool politically-correct thinking. Deal Anon? :^)

>>2712
Interesting. Good work Anon, please keep us up to date on your progress.
>contribute [...] towards creating AI waifus that can play video games.
I think there's a lot of potential crossover-interest in both /v/ and /agdg/.

# 8
>>2708
My next plans are finding places to recruit from and coming up with ways to appeal to them.  As of now I think 8/cyber/, 4/r9k/, 4/sci/, 8/tech/, 8/g/, 4/g/, 8/fur/,8/pone/, 4/mlp/, mlpol.net, 4/pol/, 4/tg/, 4/quest/, end/b/, and 9/b/ are all good candidates for our first wave of recruitment.  In later stages we will go after forums and youtube comments.  Maybe even reddit or twitter if there are still communities worth going after on those platforms.  Eventually we could even do IRL recruitment on college campuses with fliers.

# 9
>>2714
A controversial list around these parts, but I like it! Please proceed Anon, I think we're more than experienced and capable enough here to deal with any mini-shitstorms that might appear from such communities. :^)

BTW, care to share your pasta and OP images here so we can all have a look at them first?

# 10
>>2715
I don't have a pasta or OP images yet and I want to have different pastas for different types of communities.  Also lainchan and wizchan may also be worth recruiting on.

# 11
>>2716
Possibly fchan too, but I don't know anything about the community there.

# 12
>>2716
Well, when you work out some pastas, I'd appreciate seeing them here Anon. OP images too. Take your time.
>Also lainchan [...] may also be worth recruiting on.
Heh, maybe we can serve as a de-programming facility for some of them. I'd say go for it.
>

# 13
We will need different strategies for recruiting from 4cuck compared to other imageboards.  The mods there will just delete threads trying to advertise this board so we will need to advertise this board in the comments where the faggot jannies are less likely to see it.

# 14
>>2719
Good point. I'd completely forgotten about that issue, we're so laid-back here about people's freedoms to do as they please. Probably won't be an uncommon point in a number of communities, if the Admins there are grasping and threatened. 4cuck$ and 8kuck$ are two obvious examples. There may be others.

You'll need some craftiness OP.

# 15
I would also like to a see a few suggestions for communities to recruit from before I start making pasta and finding OP images.  The computer I am on does not have photoshop or gimp and I'm not really sure this peace of shit would even be able to run them.  I won't have access to a good computer for a while.  If someone here could make an "I Want You" with a robowaifu on it that would be great for recruitment.

# 16
>>2721
Anywhere on the webring. It's already sort of self-moderating. I would say ''not'' from anywhere in the alt-Tranny-Federation, but a number on your list are already just as bad if not worse so they are fair game too.

I'm on a potato-box too but it runs GIMP fine under Arch. Sadly, I'm not much into arts rn, being more left-brained focused. I'd say just grab some appropriate memes, etc., and post them here. Then I or others can try to edit them for you.

# 17
>>2713
I just save the pics as resources. I don't use every question or prompt in it's entirety. You have to answer those things 1:1 without any creative liberty. I also think it's important to take note of what you don't want, which is why I don't edit these things beyond file names. Your waifu has to have dislikes too.

Whew, got audio now and can now switch back and forth between supervision. Almost got two player implemented as well. Now I just gotta plug in the learning algorithm and pray it doesn't take a century to train. If it works I'll see what aggy daggy thinks and put a thread up here.

# 25
/server/ & /hover/ here
This board is still linked on 8kun /hover/, updated since it moved sites.

I do my best to be active when able, but had some issues lately (like with tooling, resources and health concerns) There's a lot to consider. Good oscilloscopes are expensive in general. Artificial intelligence deep learning can take a long time to get into properly. Security issues and so on.

# 26
>>2735
Nice, thanks for the update Anon! Since this is the recruitment thread, some Anons might miss your good work and I think this project deserves a thread of it's own. Care to start a new thread too about your project for us Anon, regardless? And yes, I hope some of the /agdg/ lads might join us here.

>>2736
Hi there mate, good seeing you. I absolutely love /server/, I'll add you to our friends listing.

Yes, it's a big set of problems we're trying to tackle here, but hey that's where the fun is right? 
>
Our kiwi-doll thread from back in the day, and progress with chatboxes more recently make me think that Anon can be producing those kinds of daki pillows for inexpensive-and-entirely-doable-today kits, for starters. Could be a good start without mucking about with all the expensive gear etc, you mention.

(Pasta tailored to tech and cyberpunk communities)
Subject: /robowaifu/ wants you
   The future is now, anon.  AI, robotics, and material science have reached a point where robowaifus are now in the realm of possibility.  We need anons with skills of all kinds: artists, scientists, engineers, programmers, makers, writefags and more are all needed to bring our robotic wives into reality.  Come and join our multidisciplinary team of robowaifus technicians and be a part of a better tomorrow.

(Pasta for incels, MGTOW, lonely men)
Subject:  Join the robowaifu revolution
  Let's face it anon, modern women just aren't worth it.  Feminism and modernity have made relationships into nightmare for men, but we have a solution.  Our multidisciplinary team of robowaifu technicians is working tirelessly to make robot wives into a reality.  Join us in our charge to build and design the women of the future.

(Pasta for furfags, horsefuckers, and monster girl fans)
   How badly do you want your (horse/monster/anthro) gf, anon?  What would you do to feel her fluffy tail in your hand?  (To stroke her fur/brush her mane/tail(s))?  To hold her in your arms?  Our multidisciplinary team of robowaifu technicians is here to help.  Robots can take any shape you desire, anon.  With your help we can bring your waifu into reality.

This is what I have so far.  Thoughts?

# 28
I would also like picture of popular robowaifus pointing so I can shoop a hat on them and write "/robowaifu/ wants you" under them.

# 29
>>2778
>>2779
It's a good start afaict tell Anon, though I'm no real writefag tbh. Maybe others here can chime in as well please?

But at the least I'd say:
- you have the target audience squarely focused properly, 
- you're showing some of the benefits of participation, 
- and most importantly--''you're keeping the texts short''. You certainly shouldn't use a novel in some of the environments where triggered-tranny-&-stronk_independynts have been installed as hotpockets to keep wrongthink at bay for their victims.

BTW, as I see things:
>A)
You'll need to regularly devise new pasta for these environments, b/c wordfilters set up against it.
>B)
You'll need to regularly ''run your trap-line'' to check for responsive questions by legitimate, curious Anons. Remember you're more or less serving as an Ambassador for /robowaifu/ in that context.

I'll think about any scenes with waifus that are suitable for the Uncle Sam Poster mashups, maybe some other Anons can too. Good work Anon.

As pointed out by our resident AI researcher

There aren't any practical robowaifu projects/kits yet either. It's simply too early at this stage. You might look to our Welcome thread for reference as response fodder.

We are still in our formative period, in fact **of course :^)**. Perhaps you can even capitalize on that fact with Anons

Really good idea. Here's a thought: since we're already sort of adopting Chii herself as our board-tan, what about using one of her pink & white hair-clips positioned on a circular background using the baby-blue & white colors of the logo portion of the board's background image here? Have the '/robowaifu/' tag in the darker blue of the ring--again just like the logo portion--below that against a field of white. That icon should be pretty recognizable immediately to anyone who's actually seen the show, and for others it's simple design should be quickly associated with the /robowaifu/ 'brand'.

It's not likely something I'm going to take on, I have a lot on my plate already and more on the soon horizon. If someone else is interested in managing this process and is serious about the welfare of the board and our community, then make an account here on Julay, and I'll add you as a /robowaifu/ vol.

What do you guys think about targeting the far right as potential allies in the fight for robowaifus.  On one hand they will almost certainly see it as degenerate, but on the other they know what robowaifus are going to do to feminism.  Would they actually help us?

This

# 96

>>2884
heh, i saw that too. ok, something else then. but don't just complain Anons, get those creative juices going and give us some ideas and sketches ! :^)

>>2883
certainly the feminism/effeminism effects that have effectively doomed the West and led to the need for robowaifus in the first place certainly come from the left and not from the right. not sure how 'far' far right you mean anon. conservatives sure, but they would be 3rd in line to condemn us right behind the feminsts & SJWs haha.

# 97
>>2885
I'm think about traditionalists, fascists, monarchists, and white nationalists types.

# 98
>>2887
One of the other reasons I think they may help us is because there are a lot of lonely guys in those movements.  Sure they have their morals, but how strictly would they adhere to them when they have the real possibility of companionship?

# 99
>>2885
How about a gear with the symbol for female in the middle of it with the words "mulier ex machina" stretching across the top of the gear and /robowaifu/ under the female symbol.

# 100
Are there any ecelebs I should follow on gab?

# 101
Just had a thought on something everyone can do to help /robowaifu/ grow.  Any time you have an opportunity to mention robowaifu an other community or group seize it.  If someone brings up how shit women are direct them here.  If someone mention love dolls or sex bots direct them here.  If someone mentions tfw no gf direct them here.

# 102
>>2887
Sure, I don't see why not in general. You're right we'll be viewed as fundamentally degenerate by them in a group-think kind of way, I think. Honestly, I have no concerns about that,  Not their cup of tea, and that's OK.

But then again, the ones who are awake will also see the field's significant advantage in resisting the much bigger problem for them (and everyone else) of feminism. The broader culture will probably always try to lump all of us together as ''dem ebil vidya-playing nahdzees'' anyway, so probably not much of a distinction there tbh.

>>2889
Very symbolic, I like it. Maybe we can add 'gentle human' into the mix somehow, ''Mulier Humanus Ex Machina''? Care to give us a rough sketch so our draw-friends can have a go with your idea? Maybe you're a draw-friend yourself?

On second thoughts, if by 'the symbol for female' you mean the modern feminist-remashed symbol (like pic related w/o the '=') then no. We need something classic that's evocative of Venus, not  **Fem*n**.

# 105
>>2898
What about a ring but the band is replaced with a gear?

# 106
>>2900
Clever idea, would probably be a nice symbol. But in my opinion there's just too much stigma attached to the symbol form itself today. It would be obnoxious having to look at it regularly, much less adopting it as our logo.

Something with 'V' would be nice maybe. Even something related to the famous Venus painting itself Anon?

Alright, I finished your logo to what I ''think'' the specifications were.
I made three versions. Two with the slashes in different places, and one without and slashes.
If anyone wants to try something else, they can use the transparent hairband image I made.

# 109
>>2903
Certainly that would have a nice implication all on it's own, quite apart from the shape. I think that's a keeper.

>>2904
Thanks Anon. Unfortunately, I think the general consensus now is that in isolation--especially for the uninitiate--Chii's hairpin simply resembles an onahole too much to be suitable as our public logo. **I'm sure it will be good for in-joke ecchi humor in the future though haha**.

I noticed that, but hoped that a side view of the hair thing would be more acceptable.

Would a heart with traces be good? I made a 3D model of a sort-of medallion thing which used this as a concept.
It prints quite nicely on my potato-grade 3D printer, but it was a bitch to get off the bed.
I could do something like that, but 2D and with a baby blue and white background.

# 111
>>2906
>I noticed that, but hoped that a side view of the hair thing would be more acceptable.
Yeah, I thought a side-view might be better as well, once I saw the layout of my idea in perspective. But I guess we should drop the hairband thing. Oh well.

>heart medallion
Sure let's see. I personally ''do'' like the pastel 'baby' colors, I think they make a good color scheme. Ofc thinking about it now, we probably should try lots and lots of ideas out first before finalizing on a design. It's the typical way it's done professionally in graphics houses, and I think it would serve us well here too. Please proceed Anon.

Why not only go for /sci/ and /g/ boards? While these other groups may have an interest in the topic and some among them may be knowledgable, wouldn't it be better to only go to places where you know people are into STEM? Some people like that may also be put off if they come and see most of the first page filled with religion, politics and magic discussion, which is probably all that some of these groups will contribute.

It's a good point, but as I mentioned before in the 'community growth & cohesion' section, I'd like us to ''"...all go out of our way to strive to be patient and helpful to newcomers over the next few months, myself included."'' >>2701 The ambassadorial thread in particular needs to be accommodating to others who are new here. I'll do my part to restrain Majick-Anon's activity on /robowaifu/ if it becomes essential to do so.

And for my part concerning my own Christianity, if a philosophical topic or position is already being presented by Anon in a thread, I'll make an honest response if I feel the need to. I don't generally start these kinds of conversations but simply present my **usually-alternate :^)** POV. Even if it's uncomfortable on both sides, this is only proper in my opinion. I'm certainly open to suggestions on this topic.

It's certainly a good suggestion for recruitment-Anon and the rest of us to focus on sci-tech communities for outreach, but frankly, much of what we're attempting here involves deep and/or mysterious topics such as the human soul, etc., so I don't think it's entirely possible to avoid theological discussions here, even if we made a strong and overt attempt to do so.

I don't think it's possible for us to succeed at this huge task without lucidity and wisdom on all fronts. If,  for example, that means acknowledging the clearly-designed biological systems surrounding the coding mechanisms inside DNA  for example--and drawing inspirations for our own designs from that observation--then I willing to let the metaphysical chips fall where they may here.

Honestly, I think you should stick to IBs until the dust settles, so to speak. Let this find a little equilibrium first would be my advice. After that, lather, rinse, repeat once for the sites that took your threads down. Other than that, the communities themselves have to adopt their own interest in robowaifus, I think. You can't ''force'' things on anyone ofc.

Beyond that, I'd say use the two social media accounts you set up on voat and gab?

# 128
Maybe just 'make the rounds' every couple of months until interest grows? Summer is coming up, which will mean increased traffic on IBs.

# 129
Everyone, please take note of the proper place to promote /robowaifu/ on nanochan:
>>3050
>As a rule we do not allow imageboard advertising threads outside of /b/ or the dedicated thread on /l/,
Thank you.

# 130
So one anon in the meta thread brought up a good point, and that is that lots of people aren't going to want to use an imageboard because of the negative stigma around them.  Would it be possible for us to make a separate forum type website that we would control that we could send nonimageboard users to?  It would certainly decrease our risk factors when recruiting from certain groups.

# 131
>>3120
Probably a decent idea. It would have to be a 'sister site' alongside us, and I'm not up for managing more than just the /robowaifu/ IB itself, currently Anon. If anyone wants to step up, just make an account here on julay, and I'll add you as a board vol. Then you can make sites, etc., on our behalf.

# 132
>>3120

That's probably me you're referencing, and yeah from the perspective of a new anon here I had my reservations at first about exploring to much of Julay since I thought foreign boards besides 4chan were likely reserved for full on p-bears. The only reason I kept on was because Reddit kept deleting all the good "wrong think" subs and I was desperate for a new non conformist community. 

Honestly I don't really foresee anyone making as much effort as I which was required to find this place since at first google seemed to outright block most of my queries involving companion / waifu bots / alternative forums and even then I had to crawl through many duckduckgo results while simultaneously navigating a bunch of other IBs which were either dead, suspicious or slow/dying (looking at you LainChain).

In terms of a forum, I feel like it'd only be possible if it was private and invite only. While it'd be infinitely easier to navigate, organize and interpret info, it would for sure dampen user join rates (which would otherwise be possible on a public platform).

>>3125

Like Chobitsu mentioned, I think a sister board would be the best option.

# 133
>>3146
>reserved for full on p-bears
What's a p-b... wait, I likely don't want to know.
Not that I touch the stuff that often, but Google probably does block IBs. I know they had outright bans on linking to 4chan, & Hotwheels put in a request not index 8chan, which I believe they honored. /robowaifu/ is the number 1 hit on most of the other engines ''if you use that term''. I'm not sure what other closely-related contextually terms will yield however.

So after hearing your adventure to get to us, first off let me say congratulations! Secondly how did you actually manage it in the end Anon? What was the ''one'' key? Maybe that will give Recruiter-Anon here some ideas.

>While it'd be infinitely easier to navigate, organize and interpret info
There's an Anon who mentioned starting a wiki for us, and I've been tinkering around learning the basics of writing a **thick** book.

# 134

Funny enough while Reddit drove me away, it also helped me find you guys. Usually when I'm looking for more niche communities I add "reddit" to see if there any discussions on any subject. The process went roughly like this though (ommitting useless queries)

r/KIA2 warns that IBs are begin attacked and most likely they were going to be as well. They mention 8chan. 
https://www.reddit.com/r/kotakuinaction2/comments/gewvte/8chanmoe_is_live_supporting_free_speech_gg/

googling 4chan sites brings me this but nothing more, read about and started trying to figure out what lynxchan vs Vichan is.
https://www.16chan.xyz/b/res/9601.html

I eventually duckduckgo "lynxchan" + "reddit" and find the infinitechan sub where someone mentions julay.world
https://www.reddit.com/r/infinitechan/comments/gayhfj/hey_retards_heres_the_alt_sites_anons_are_going/     

I figure this is a reference to Chris Chan (is it? kek) so I visit right before the site goes down. However just before it goes down I lock eyes with /robowaifus/ and realize I found my new home. 

The next day the site disappears followed by my brief hysteria, but as you can tell I figured out there's a bunker and not all was lost.

# 135

Aye, this is a turbulent time you picked to show up, but /robowaifu/ is supposed to be on the julay rebirth anyway, assuming things go as planned.

That's quite intriguing Anon, thanks for sharing it. You certainly show a lot of persistence in finding your way here, so I applaud you for that. There's a lot to take in here (and more on the way) so just take your time here and you'll get it I'm sure.

So, do you have any specific areas of interest you know of yet? For example, I'm kind of a systems guy myself, and can do a little coding **''very'' little, some might say haha**.

Regardless, we're all glad you're here Anon, welcome.

# 137
>>3120
To add to this, the culture of 8chan and its off shoots like julay in particular can be an obstacle. Every board that originated there in some way has a feel to it that can be offputting. There's a lot of people outside of the 4chan and 8chan circles even among imageboard users, they don't use the same lingo. The kissu.moe thread kind of shows this.  Robowaifu is better in that regard. I found it through /monster/, which I only briefly looked at. During that short period I saw posts of anons telling each other to set themself on fire and that kind of thing. Bascially violent 'tism symptoms, and I've seen other people with the same opinion.

We have an armatures & skeleton thread, and we've touch on a number of topics related to this here in the past as well. My own current interests in these domains is primarily related to the kinematics and structural design constraints of bipedal-locomotion. For now, most of us are **temporarily** resigned to a ''cripplebot'' robowaifu >>2983 but I, for one, mean to change that if I can. :^)

>I've amateur experience in many useful areas like Blender, programming, photoshop and am planning on really trying to hone and put my skills to test this summer
Sounds awesome. I look forward to seeing what you devise. Just out of curiosity mind if I ask what type of programming you do? I have a specific interest in systems programming myself here.

# 142
>>3163

Well to be honest I'd still consider myself a novice without a focus atm since the core of my programming experience is comprised of Java and x86 Assembly. I originally planned to study C and progress to C++ during summer and from what I've read around in this board it seems like that's a pretty standard route to get up to date. 

For all intents and purposes (since that was kind of a vague answer), I guess it's best to say I want to focus on game deving with unity(C) then move to unreal engine(C++) as a hobby and eventually move on to embedded systems(C++) career-wise while applying that knowledge to whatever /robowaifu/ project I'd be working on.

Also, sorry for the late replies. I'm pretty new to IBs and I've been getting lost trying to sift through as much of the board as I can.

The catalog.
https://spqrchan.xyz/robowaifu/catalog.html
All the newly-bumped threads will rise to the top of the board. After a while, you'll get used to watching the 'replies' counter. You also generally keep a tab open for any threads you have an open (unanswered, etc) post in. Whenever that thread gets a bump a number will show up on the tab and by that approach (tabs open for each open thread) you can quickly spot any new posts for the thread. At least that's been my approach. There's a 'Watched Threads' link at the top of the page as well that's possibly useful (I don't use it so I'm ignorant about it). Just be patient and keep at it Anon, and within a couple of weeks you'll be shitposting here like an oldfag pro! :^)

>[C++] and from what I've read around in this board it seems like that's a pretty standard route to get up to date. 
C is most definitely an important language, but to quote a recent post (from myself) on the v/agdg thread:
>"The fundamental burden that C places on the novice is putting the cart before the horse. You more or less have to become a guru of exceptional competence before you can create even reasonably non-trivial systems in C. With C++, you can begin to toddle towards doing so even as a novice, as I mentioned. "
> (pic related)

C will be absolutely essential in our quest to achieve robowaifus, but will be relegated primarily to small embedded micro-controllers, etc. The huge bulk of the system will be in C++, which offers high-efficiency comparable to C code, but also brings multi-mode programming with great abstraction and generic programming mechanisms. It's also much the better language for novices, when given the choice between the two (as I outlined above).

Shocked to find that in her stead
Males are done, they've had enough
Of roasties cries and mental stuff
Robots soon, the future's near
And that which gives the roastie fear
No longer will guys have to try
with perfect waifus they will lie
She kicks and screams and throws a fit
A well rehearsed and vocal skit
Her only worth has been tossed out
And all she can do is cry and pout
Her posts are short and fraught with rage
How can she compete at ripe old age?
Fingers pounding at the keys
Dumping endless pointless sleaze
Stuck inside her private hell
"I've got you now, you fucking incel!"
But nobody listened, cared or heard
Not a single bloody word
The men rejoiced and had a pint
Together on a joyous night
Roasties no longer waste our lives
Now that we've got robot wives.

# 156

Okay, didn't know about that. If this can be put into an Android or iOS app, then it might be fine. You're saying this can parse every imageboard? You mean here on Julay or everything? My point is, there should be good readers for every board like this on mobile devices. Then more people will go there, including here.

# 157
>>4307
>You're saying this can parse every imageboard?
Any board that supplies a valid JSON API, yes. It can (and will) be extended to parse IB types/sites that ''don't'' provide one as well.

>My point is, there should be good readers for every board like this on mobile devices.
The ''BUMP'' software is C++ ISO standard C++17, so the code could theoretically be ported to practically every conceivable device out there. Some adjustments to library dependencies might be needed but it should be relatively easy for anyone interested in doing so.

# 158
>>4309
Ah, okay. Amazing. I thought the reason why Omnichan  isn't supporting every board is that they would need a parser for each. There are also mainly 4chan apps.

# 159
>>4311
If you have the abilities, then I'd recommend you compile a working copy and grab any boards on Julay that you'd like to keep an archive of before they disappear forever at the changeover in 6 days.

# 160
>>4312
I think there's nothing important for me. If I had so much time I would create some app like Omnichan (don't care about the 4chan pass option), but open source, and maybe in form a a library. So for example other apps like mgtow.tv app could use it to connect only to different mgtow boards, or alternatively only one board which the app programer trusts.

# 161
>>4311
>I thought the reason why Omnichan  isn't supporting every board is that they would need a parser for each.
I have no idea why Omnichan is doing whatever they do, but yes, each board software type often has minor differences that need to be taken into account. For example Vichan and Jschan software are different in several ways but the fundamental elements are the same ideas. In my software I've just created a JSON file that maps the different tags to the ideas and after that everything's really simple to deal with just that one paradigm, not 2 dozen different ones.

>>4321
It's an interesting idea. As you've already seen, my source code is completely open-source (MIT license) and anyone is free to use it to create any kind of imageboard app they want to. Personally, I'm working it towards a distributed, private server model to try to help IBs stay resilient in the face of takedowns, etc. It's why I wrote the software in the first place, because we very nearly lost /robowaifu/ entirely in the aftermath of the 8chan red-flag operation.

Here's the /robowaifu/ logo, Ribose. If you're on a forum that supports the animated one, use that. Otherwise use the static one.

You might ask on the banners thread Anon. Perhaps someone will help out?

How much is "half size"? Anyway, here's is a smaller version of the "static" one.
Also, **I am not the anon that posted ITT a couple months ago. (But we are all anonymous anyway :^)**

Ahh, I see then. That size is fine, and thanks again. Nice work!

So I was inspired by the Toua Juukou (Toua Heavy Industry) logo from Sidonia no Kishi (and others mangas) that uses a stylized "to" (ト) and made a robowaifu variant with the katakana "ro" (ロ).

Worked on the font of the weeboo version.

These are great, and I predict--prophetic. Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and others are already getting into the service robotics game and in the future they and many other major industrial interests will also begin offering robowaifu companions. 

I'd like to think that somehow at least some of us here from /robowaifu/ will be a part of what is sure to be a gigantic industry one day.

kek. with some minor changes, #1 could be a reasonable banner, actually.

Made this a long time ago and posted it in another thread. Fixed it up a bit and am reposting because it's extremely relevant.

Euphoria I responded to your banner post.

Just imagine what a large troupe of robowaifus could do along this line. You could even have them singing, dancing, and doing gymnastics as well!

Just wondering if it would be a good idea to attempt recruitment IRL by leaving /robowaifu/ tear-off dockets with this web URL inside male toilets. I can place them in the engineering and computer science buildings of my local uni. The library. That sort of thing. I give zero fux about feminist/sjw shaming. To me this is legitimate robotics and craftsmanship. Besides, they have their crappy victim-status movement, we autistic males need one too! A rallying point that isn't focused around hatred, but solutions.

I am thinking of printing some of the page banners onto dockets and stickers along with a short and to-the-point description: "D.I.Y female robotic companions" (less webspeak so as to appeal to as wide an audience as possible).

Also I want to get something together on my deviant art so that the few hundred people who see my old art gallery every month may be interested in coming here. We need more men made aware of robowaifus if they are going to become a reality!

Sure, go for it. Just be aware of surveillance systems being commonplace. Your movements are automatically tracked by Big Brother on something like a Uni campus, so you can very likely be pinned down eventually if you're leaving materials around. ''Don't do anything illegal mate''.

But heh, you already live in ''Airstrip One'' don't you? No need to remind you, but just practice good OPSEC. Certainly try hard not to dox yourself online at the least.

> A rallying point that isn't focused around hatred, but solutions.
Absolutely. That's the whole point here, and you seem to understand that very well so thanks for reminding us.

The Mercury symbol ☿ is the Venus symbol with protusions coming out of it, we can call them antennas and associate it with robowaifus.

>Don't do anything illegal mate.
LOL wise advice. But that's another thing that appeals to me about /robowaifu/. No illegal stuff (although obvs I have to get permission to put up posters and pamphlets rather than just fly post). 

Before I found out about this board I frequented 8kun and 4chan. Both of them were full of people acting like fanatical Neo Nazis, the Khmer Rouge or just the clinically insane.  A few people wanted to hoard canned food, grow their own veg and arm themselves to the teeth so they could live the rest of their lives in a bunker, but that's about the most creativity I saw. Lots of memes, rage and depression. Very few solutions.

Being upset about politics all the time can be damaging. They don't discuss solutions anyways. It's only wasting time and being angry. Which can have effects on how well to learn stuff or getting upset about problems much faster, because they're just the icing on the cake of worries.
So yeah it's better to focus on tech and watching anime to relax. "Entertainment" which is to much driven by permanent conflicts between people also only increases stress. It can't be good to have that the whole time. There's a reason why watching 'My Little Pony' became popular among hackers or other IT guys. They need to relax and have some distance to the world.
Btw, I just delayed working on some code for more than seven hours, because I had so enough of it, only to find the solution for the last problem I had with it in literally less than 20sec.

>>7696 Well that is good to hear, anon. Hope it gets you closer to your goals! Just goes to show how important rest is for the human brain.

More than once, I've literally woken up from bed with the correct answer to a coding problem at my fingertips when I got on the editor, and even for other issues in life as well. You can often hear the answer being given to you if you're doing the right thing and get quiet. And be patient about it too. I second the other anon's advice about giving yourself some rest when you're constantly struggling for a solution to something. Taking a break from it for a bit can actually be important to finding the right answer for things.

Heh, cute idea but the basic point is to ''not'' emulate that now-degenerate symbology. Find something that evokes the beauty of the mythological ''Venus'' in a readily understandable icon at a glance.

Think Botticelli's ''Birth of Venus'', mate.
