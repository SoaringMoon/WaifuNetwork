Minimum viable waifu.

In this thread, we'll discuss what our minimums for waifus are. Be it software, hardware, physical appearance, etc. This will help us focus in on what are the minimum goals we need to achieve as our first steps. For me, I want a waifu that will be just tall enough to hug (about 1.3 m), able to follow me around and have conversations with, will follow basic commands like going to designated spots at designated times, and look like picrel.

I'd be fine with sk8o dressed as Senko San and basic conversation. Though I do want her to say "kon"

I plan on literally starting with an action figure. I'm not really good with my hands and don't really know what I'm doing. And with how long it takes me to do anything, I'm probably decades away from something that'd probably make me happy. Not to mention that I just can't learn to code no matter how many times I've tried, so I'd have to get money before I could pay to have an AI made. The best I could do on my own would mostly just amount to a glorified mannequin/puppet. I guess on the Human-Mecha scale, I'd be starting at 4, then gradually working up to 1. Anything that I can't get looking and moving realistically (mechanically, not because of the programming) within realistic human body proportions, will instead look overtly mechanical. And as I mentioned in another thread, the brain will be a server rack and the body will be remotely controlled.

As far as the action figure goes, right now I'm just trying to figure out how to make something with a realistic or somewhat idealized range of motion with as few parts as possible. I keep trying to figure out how to make a near 180° bend at the knee without a double-hinge.

use a single hinge?

>>9555 shows a method to describe the minimum requirements in different areas and then how to level it up.

Here some examples:
- Body movement
	      RL00 - moving head, legs and arms, but allowing them to be moved
	      RL01 - walking on all four
	      RL02 - dancing on one spot with guidance from a wall or pole
 - Facial expressions and abilities
	      RL00 - nice looking smile
	      RL01 - general cute facing
- Endurance
	      RL00 - movement in bed for one hour, some time talking and min. movement 
	      RL01 - ...
- Comfort
	      - internal self cleaning by drinking water and cleaning fluid
	      - internal storage of cleaning fluid and also lubricant for sexual usage
	      - release of internal fluids in bathtub, shower or on toilet

Generally the early trend of the initial discussion back on 8chan was: Having a "sexbot" (animated doll) which can move around in bed, and being able to move to the bathroom and clean itself up. Follow up wishes were "making a sandwich" and "washing my car".

You don't get nearly as much range of motion

The pics include a figure with no hinge at the knee, and one with the exact kind of double-hinge that I was trying to avoid.

Prosthetics are your friend. 
Human legs only bend to about 140 to 160 degrees at most.

I should probably look into human kinesiology more in general, but the flexibility of the arm or legs is mostly limited by the thickness of the limbs. It's easier to make limbs thicker than you need to, but harder to make them smaller. Making a slim, waifish contortionist waifu is a good goal to aim towards, because you can always add to it, but if you design something clunkier, you might not be able to take off of it.
