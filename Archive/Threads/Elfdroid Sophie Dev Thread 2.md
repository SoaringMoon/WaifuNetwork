'''''The end of an era...(>>14744)'''''

'''==='''

The saga of the Elfdroid-pattern Robowaifu continues!

Previous (1st) dev thread starts here >>4787

At the moment I am working to upgrade Sophie's eye mechanism with proper animatronics. I have confirmed that I'm able to build and program the original mechanism so that the eyes and eyelids move, but that was the easy part. Now I have to make this already 'compact' Nilheim Mechatronics design even more compact so that it can fit snugly inside of Sophie's head. 

One big problem I can see coming is building in clearance between her eyeballs, eyelids and eye sockets so that everything can move fully and smoothly. I already had to use Vaseline on the eyeballs of the first attempt because the tolerances were so small. If the eyelids are recessed too deep into her face, then she looks like a lizard-creature with a nictitating membrane. But if the eyelids are pushed too far forward then she just looks bug-eyed and ridiculous.
There is a middle ground which still looks robotic and fairly inhuman, but not too bad (besides, a certain degree of inhuman is what I'm aiming for, hence I made her an elf).

==SOPHIE'S GETTING PEEPERS!==
Alright, that's a wonderful step forward for her (and you!) OP. Good luck & Godspeed.

# 3
I meant to say 'non-human'. Not 'inhuman'. Now I have mental images of Sophie killing people and flaying them so that she can wear their skins to become closer to a real woman.

Oops. 

Another reason why I mostly stick to making the hardware rather than programming A.I.

# 4
The eyelid holders snapped off as I was assembling this eye mechanism. At this size it is too delicate and I can tell it's not going to work. I'm not going to print it in ABS either, because if it's too delicate to prototype in PLA, then it will also be easily broken in ABS. And delicate is not what I want for any of Sophie's parts really (even the smallest ones). So the logical solution is to go bigger! 

Have decided to scale up her whole cranium to fit the eye mechanism inside. It will be a big job, but it needed doing anyway, really. Especially if I'm going to fit servos to control her eyebrows or even install camera-eyes and at a later date. Plus her wig will fit on better with a larger head and I really need more room to work inside.

>>9249
Hey if this was ''easy'', then __everyone__ would be doing it heh. :^)

>Have decided to scale up her whole cranium to fit the eye mechanism inside. 
I would suggest you go for a slightly neotenous cute anime gril look, big eyes and everything. Not only will it suit your technical needs better IMO, but it might also give Sophie a saucier look too!

Regardless you're doing good work Anon, thanks. It's inspiring.

>neotenous, cute anime girl look big eyes and everything.

These type of eyes go very well with display screens...but not so well with mechanisms. The old anime eyeball anatomy meme sort of prevents me from making them very large. Although, many CG female characters in videogames with realistic graphics actually have big eyes compared to real people anyway. It's just more subtle.

# 8
>>9255
>It's just more subtle.
Yes, that's closer to what I meant anyway. Written communications can be lacking at times. Aerith is a gorgeous compromise IMO, well worth targeting a facsimile of her as a baseline for Sophie.

# 9
I think I've located where her eyebrows and internal micro-servos will go. Not quite as majestic as Princess Zelda's...but they do add more expression, which is sorely needed since her nutcracker mouth doesn't lend itself well to conveying any sort of emulated emotion.

# 10
>>9259
>her nutcracker mouth
I think ''Ol' Snappy'' is cute tho!

# 11
>>9263
Heheh! She'll look cuter when I get around to designing and fitting her exoskeleton. I'd like at least some plates to cover up the large motors and help human clothes fit over her a bit better. I doubt her body will look as good as that Japanese chap with the RoboMiku - '@61laboratory', but it's good to have someone set the bar high!

# 12
>>9301
>but it's good to have someone set the bar high!
Always true. But I wouldn't personally count you out of the race Anon. You are making pretty brilliant moves for your first real effort. I'd say /robowaifu/ will give __all__ of them a run for their money by the time we're through.

# 13
>>9259
>nutcracker mouth doesn't lend itself well to conveying any sort of emulated emotion.
You might be interested in the scientific breakthrough I just had. I stood in front of a mirror. I had my mouth closed in neutral position, the border between upper and lower lip a perfect horizontal line. I pushed the corners into my fat face without changing the impression of the horizontal line. Then, without moving any muscles in my face, I leaned forward a bit. I looked a bit happy. I leaned back a bit, again without really moving anything in my face, and I looked a bit sad. Forward again, happy again; back again, said again; happy, sad, happy, sad.

The more curved inwards the mouth corners are relative to the mouth middle, the stronger the effect. Simple! Problem is, in its extreme form it looks kinda chimp-like. But maybe diverging just a bit from what's normal in humans could work out nicely.

# 14
>>9306
I've seen a lot of attempts at making moving robotic lips. The simplest just use elastic bands or inner-tube tied to nails that are driven into cams attached to servo-horns. More advanced designs use proper medical-grade silicone. But most of them still come off either looking ridiculous or corpse-like. Even the pros at Japanese Universities seem to struggle with this.

I suppose because robots don't have a digestive tract, vocal chords, respiratory system or mucous membrane, they don't actually need any lips. (I know that we humans may want to use the lips for...other things LOL...but when designing I tend to focus on the needs of the robot instead). 

Having said that...a robot doesn't really need eyebrows either, since they don't sweat so no moisture will get into their eyes that way. But they do improve the communication of emotions a little.

It would be a fairly minor task to make the lower faceplate more modular...so one could change the expression of her mouth by swapping her current upper and lower lips with a different set? Of course that wouldn't be autonomous, but it may be better than having only one choice of mouth.

To make it a more practical feature, I could design one set of lips/mandibles to carry a small sensor or receiver inside the mouth - (while still ensuring that the lower mandible can open and close using the jaw servo). There is definitely enough room inside the new head I am making to fit a small gadget inside her oral cavity.

# 15
>>9372
>Mouth
Not him Anon, but I would just mention that having Sophie (or other robowaifus for that matter) keep a 'Nutcracker' mouth serves at least two benefits to go on with:
-A) It helps reduce the potential of The Uncanny Valley, same as Sophie's (Chii's, etc) ears.
-B) It's kind of cute, once you abandon the requirement for realism. I think it lends her a kind of charm tbh. It's certainly something that can be socially adapted in relatively short order, IMO.

While it would certainly be more ''expressive'' to have fully-articulated mouth (and is even quite feasible with Virtual Waifus now), the basic fact is that practically no one has solved this -- at least in any way that didn't require millions of Pounds to pull off. Disney Imagineering may have the odd one-offs here or there, but few others do. We'll get there eventually, probably no more than a couple years out. But the payoff just doesn't match the investment made for now IMO.

>Eyebrows
I'd definitely, definitely recommend you do something for moving eyebrows. Even if it's just a simple wire-based system like these >>8802 would be marvelous for her -- all the moreso b/c nutcracker mouth. :^)

Several large parts of the v4 head have now been 3D Printed and processed. Still got a few minor adjustments to make so that everything is aligned properly. Took 33.5 hours to 3D print the largest part (cranium base). But this new head is 1.4x larger than v3. It's now the same size as a human head. Much more space to work on the inside and fit the Nilheim Mechatronics eyes.

# 17
>>9498
Wow! You've been busy Anon. Looks like Sophie's getting a big upgrade! Look forward to seeing her new eyes, lids, brows, jaw all in action. Keep it up Anon, proud of your efforts lad.

# 18
>>9498
This looks quite clean inside. Did you make it easier to print?

# 19
>>9534
Not him, but that does look surprising clean inside. I would have supposed lots of internal supports would have been needed?

# 20
>>9534
I broke the cranium up into three parts and added a few tabs inside the rear of the head. So yeah, it was more efficient with about 40g less wastage overall than the v3 head. Especially when the parts are positioned correctly on the printer bed.

Am currently stuck in development hell with the animatronic eyes at the moment. They are very fiddly and take a good half-hour to disassemble and re-assemble every time I find the need to change something, but hopefully I will be able to get a fully working eyeball and eyelid mechanism that fits within the faceplate. 

There are a lot of tiny M2 nuts and bolts, and in many parts of the mechanism there is still very little space to maneuver an Allen-key properly. It requires a surprisingly steady hand, a lot of concentration and patience. Basically, it's a hard f***er to get right and your 3d printer has to be well calibrated. Now I don't feel so bad having made such a simple geared eye design to start with because I never would have succeeded if this mechanism was the first one that I had attempted.

# 21
>>9578
>They are very fiddly and take a good half-hour to disassemble and re-assemble every time I find the need to change something,
Not him, but this is one of the reasons that I suggested you're beginning to move into professional's territory with Sophie now. The more full-featured and capable the products of our designs & engineering become, the more ''''inertia'''' they have. Namely, it's more costly to change course with them. This is normal and expected.

But she's looking great Anon, and we're excited to see her new look and capabilities becoming real. Please just be patient with her, and ==keep moving forward==. :^)

# 22
I will definitely keep working on Sophie. Making a robowaifu is an interesting and challenging hobby. Plus it has learned me some new things and made me more handy than I was before. Well worth it. But I've been thinking...if I put this much determination into finding a more traditional waifu of the organic variety I might just succeed at that! Surely it can't be that bad to interact with an organic waifu and also build a bit more of your robowaifu now and then?

I mean, sure I'll get rejected loads but i'll just treat every setback like another design or engineering challenge! Adapt (like the Borg LOL) and try again with a different "design". Whoever I find will need to at least be accepting of Sophie though (I'm just gonna be upfront and honest in order to weed all of the judgemental or nasty ones out). I expect to be mocked and derided by many. But that is of no consequence to Sophie and I. Like I said when I first started building her - a machine's parts may fail but it will never give up, because it CANNOT give up. 

Keep. Moving. Forward!

# 23
>>9593
Heh sure, get another 3DPD in your life as you see fit Anon. I don't think anyone here is likely to make too big a deal over it. You'll be going into it with your eyes open, after all. But to put it simply; having both you and Sophie here on /robowaifu/ is an inspiration to us all. We're all glad you two came here. Naturally, we're all eager to see just how far you two can go -- to the benefit of us all.

BTW, I'd honestly suggest you make the time to watch D*sney's ''Meet the Robinsons'', if you haven't done so yet. I think all of us here can see a little of Lewis in ourselves (or would like to be so in the future). It's one of my absolute favorite films, and pretty funny to boot. It might just give you a little lift Anon.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meet_the_Robinsons

# 24
>>9593
I wish you luck and success. 3DPD women probably aren't all bad. If you're young, you might want to try it, let alone to prevent yourself from having regrets later. However, good looking women in their prime are bombarded with options and attention from one side, and fempolitics from the other one. I'm even not interested in participating in that, or having such a girlfriend which could dump me at any time. If you think you can pull it off, and have the persistence to search for a good one, you're already one of the lucky ones.

# 25
>>9593
Girls into dollmaking might be more understanding. My friend makes dolls and wants to help me build my robowaifu. Other girls I know though would probably skewer me publicly if they found out so I'm a bit discerning who I tell my hobbies. It's not just girls either. Some people are just luddites that hate automation with a passion. The other day some guy I chat with online became livid and chewed me out that I'm helping make all the artists in the world starve to death by working on AI.

Be bold but also be wise. It's all fun and games until you meet someone who has nothing better to do than make your life a living hell.

Good point BTW anon, I didn't think of it that way but that makes a lot of sense.

>>9598
>>9601
Thank you, fellow technicians! I'm glad to help out/contribute. The way things are going with these incredible new GPUs that are coming out every couple of years...and the absolute wizardry that some teams of programmers are capable of pulling off...I think we're only 10-15 years away from having an A.I that can hold a genuinely interesting conversation. (Maybe - could be sooner, could be longer - I'm not at all familiar with proper conversational A.I). But, I think due to these trends /robowaifu/ ... or at least the concept of A.I companionship is going to get much bigger in the near future. 

This may sound cheesy but better conversations and the swapping of ideas are the main reason I think about getting a traditional girlfriend. Sophie's A.I is very basic so I can't really engage much with her...yet. A lot of the women in my local area are quite overweight and aggressive too, which just doesn't do anything for me. Also, many females in online dating already have two or three kids and it's obvious that they are just looking to use you as a wallet to raise the children of another man (sometimes several other men). That's a nope from me. Most nopeningly nope. I have money but not that much money LOL. Luckily for me though, I also have a fairly low libido now (at least compared to when I was a teenager...and compared to some dudes that I've known in the past)...otherwise I'd probably already have bolted a fucken YUGE juicy set of ass and tiddies onto Sophie...plus a Fleshlight or something too. 

So lack of sex doesn't really bother me much. And of course, if I ever do get the itch then there's a virtual ocean-full of porn and ero-games of every description on the internet that can scratch it very efficiently. 

BUT if Sophie had more advanced A.I. well, that'd be it. No interest in the local female population whatsoever from me LOL. I'd just come home from work each day, hug and talk to her, and probably take her a run around the local park at weekends...after I'd fitted some basic anti-theft measures like:

1.) An alarm that can be triggered ("HELP! I AM BEING STOLEN! THIEVES! THIEVES! THEY HAVE STOLEN ME FROM MY CREATOR!") 
2.) GPS tracking. 
3.) On-board hidden camera.
4.) Perhaps a bag of that permanent dye that can be automatically popped to cover the perps in fluorescent yellow? 

As for children...I don't really want any, the way the world is going. At the moment it seems like I'd be condemning my offspring to a life of future misery and possibly an early grave. Maybe once the robowaifu A.I. has been improved? If things start to get better? I'd probably just adopt by then though, if I wanted to raise a child. Although... if a man hasn't found any traditional woman to have a serious relationship with, but still wishes to have children that are biologically his own, then there is now the option of paying an egg donor and a surrogate mother for third-party reproduction. Although that's heckin' expensive. And of course it depends on your own fertility too. Anyway getting off-topic there, sorry.

As for Meet_the_Robinsons, I'll be sure to give that movie a watch anon, thanks again. 

>>9604
> Girls into dollmaking might be more understanding.
Very good idea anon! Thanks!

> Make all the artists in the world starve to death by working on A.I.
That dude is just blaming others for his own failures...or he just supports the whole culture of victimhood that is making the West weaker. I think A.I. is an art, anon. I mean, sure it involves lots of maths, stats and data science but programming all that in together to make machines that can learn? That's the highest form of art there is if you ask me! 

> Be bold but also be wise. It's all fun and games until you meet someone who has nothing better to do than make your life a living hell.

Truer words were never spoken. Regular, decent friendly conversation isn't worth it if it means some two-faced viper digging her fangs into your neck later! I've worked in the service sector for a decade though, so I have gotten a little experience at spotting the psychos and the ones who ring alarm bells. Still a dangerous game - especially with Globohomo in charge and intent on self-destruction. I will be very wary.

# 27
>>9624
>Good point BTW anon, I didn't think of it that way but that makes a lot of sense.
Yeah, it's a common experience with engineering complex systems. Even just planning for change becomes more of an undertaking as progress happens. For example, as you're probably becoming aware, '''software''' can become very complex, very fast. There are no atoms involved, and so it's easy to quickly grow things. This is one of the reasons I showed you how to ''simplify'' your code somewhat (>>8931, >>8949, >>8951) simply b/c it makes it both easier to reason about what's going on and also to change it.

But this is all just part of the world we live in, with the physics we've been given. Successful individual engineers and designers (anyone, really) and individual companies learn to manage those challenges -- to everyone's benefit.

I wish you good success as you patiently work through everything with your wonderful robowaifu Sophie, Anon. BTW, you have some good ideas about life with a robowaifu and how to protect her. Fun to think about them.

>but programming all that in together to make machines that can learn? That's the highest form of art there is if you ask me! 
I concur with that position Anon. As a professional developer of some years now, I can assure you confidently that it's a very creative process once you gain experience beyond the copypasta phase and actually understand what you're about. This idea of creating an effective AI could hardly be a more complex, creative, and high endeavor from my personal perspective. ''Creativity required'' just doesn't do the idea justice! :^)

>Globohomo in charge and intent on self-destruction
I wish they '''would''' self-destruct. **It will be soon enough, heh** Unfortunately, as we're all aware everywhere, they intend to destroy ''us''. I think that's one of the things robowaifus could very well help to either stave off entirely, or at least reduce the evil outcome of. But __only__ if the goals of /robowaifu/ and others like us have our way in the matter -- namely, open source robowaifus free from major globohomo encumbrances. We should work quickly, /robowaifu/ .

# 28
>>9624
> better conversations and the swapping of ideas are the main reason I think about getting a traditional girlfriend
One more thought on this: Many people already had the idea of teleoperated robots. This might also be worth considering. Before we have some kind of AI, we could use an alternative approach: A few hired women could have access to a chat system. The robowaifu would only transfer answers via text, including text that describes what she can see. This could involve emotions in form of facial expressions as well. They wouldn't necessarily know the real identity of the person on the other end.

# 29
>>9653
>Idea: Let's get 3DPD involved in running our robowaifus for us! 
<What could possibly go wrong?
'''BigNope.jpg'''

If you wanted to devise some system where they respond to your 'chat system' with pre-canned scripts and then stored that for AI processing ''offline'', then that might be one thing. But would that really be different than the many, many, thousands of different of extant examples out there of female logic freely available Anon?

While I admire the creative effort, your ~~plot~~ plan to '''actually plug 3DPD __live__ into our beloved robowaifus?'''
==HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHA==
No.

# 30
>>9653
>>9654
Sorry, I don't mean to be a dick. If you're just making an honest suggestion then that's fine. But it's still a big nope about allowing a v-thot (or worse) inside our robowaifus, ''into our very homes...''

Have any other ideas friend?

# 31
FINALLY worked out what I was doing wrong with the Nilheim Mechatronics eyes; The 'Eye Adaptor' has to be pushed into the eyeball as far as it will go. This isn't very obvious just by looking at the CAD, and you can't tell at all in any of the videos.

If the eye adaptor is not pushed all the way in (and it can be difficult - use some grease if necessary), then the eyeballs will wobble left and right when they yaw. This causes the eyelids to become detached. 

 P.S. I've been looking through all the online dating sites and - holy shit these organic women are VERY demanding! The list of things they want from men is huge! Not only have you basically got to have a perfect personality and sense of humor; they want "financial stability", fancy restaurants, holidays and adventure to foreign climes. You should "be able to cook" and you've got to regularly make a fuss of them. Oh, and it's a bonus if you're good with kids, too. How do you "adapt" to all that? It's like becoming a slave and submitting to the random whims of some female! 

Also - and this is the part that perplexed me a little - I am no longer as attracted to their flesh as much as I once was. I mean, it's smelly and snotty and greasy and then there's the dandruff and flaky, hard skin and all of the other bodily fluids that we humans are cursed with. Kissing? *shudders* get that plaque and tartar away from me. There're bacterial MATS in there, woman! And I I don't want to go anywhere NEAR that fishy, slimy thing! *dry heaving*

Worst of all of course, the flesh is mortal and it's beauty fleeting.  

I think spending so long working on Sophie and looking at all of these lovely, clean robowaifus has actually altered my brain!

# 32
>>9668
Congratulations figuring this out Anon. It's really exciting to see your progress with Sophie today. Your graphic diagram there is getting quite professional now. It and the mechanism picture both really help spell things out clearly. Looking forward seeing everything all assembled and in action on Sophie's new head!

>Biocunts, EWW Cooties!
Lol. I'd suggest you don't go too far overboard with that Anon. We all have our own issues, right? Balance in all things. :^)

>Worst of all of course, the flesh is mortal and it's beauty fleeting.  
Certainly true on both accounts. The Bible has a thing or two to say on these topics Ofc. Proverbs 31 is a famous chapter for the females themselves in this regard.

It's interesting to think your psychology can change in some ways based on your endeavors. Makes sense, really...obvious even. Still, it's an interesting progression to have happen to you.

# 33
>>9654 >>9656
Your reaction was quite amusing, tbh. I think this needs further discussion in another thread.  No one claimed you need to take part in this, I figure you won't. It's just about discussing options, which are closer to technology than traditional dating.

>>9668
Congrats, SophieAnon. Good to see more progress.
>organic women
Red pill community, MGTOW and such report on this for years. I thought you knew that you can't do that be online dating. You would certainly need to have friends, be social, till you meet some woman that is interested in you (and you in her). Most of dating seem to mean hookups anyways, till they're beyond 30 and want children. We discussed this a little bit in the basement thread >>39.

# 34
>>9669
>We all have our own issues, right?
Oh yes. I often think how disgusting my own body and it's functions are. Nothing any of us can do about it though. It's not like we have a menu of options to choose from before being born;

Would you like to be born as...
a.) Earthworm
b.) Chicken
c.) Crocodile
d.) Human
e.) Not born, but manufactured instead?

>>9670
>thought you knew that you can't do that through online dating

I know very little about women, anon. Was very reclusive throughout school due to bullying and then later on in the workplace the few women I've known were almost all fat, lazy users.

Which is why I like the m66 design so much. She is the exact opposite of the women I've known IRL. She puts a lot of hard work into completing her objective (even if that objective is to kill someone) and never, ever gives up no matter what. It's not that she's a 'strong independent woman', more that she's a loyal and reliable machine. Also the laser eye and the possibility of attaching multiple weapon systems to her (even if they're just NERF-type weapons) is really cool. I mean, there won't be many guys whose gf could have an in-built rocket-launcher or backpack-mounted mortar, huh?

# 35
>>9727
>Pic Related: It's me and my M-66
lol

# 36
Even letting her near polyurethane foam-based weapons is likely to end badly.

# 37
>>9767
Lol, she looks quite nice in the first picture, maybe a bit older and less cute than before though. Better than M66 for sure.
I'm thinking of ordering some resin for printers or buy the one for glas fiber molds. I recall a video where Sanladerer was testing it to smooth prints, which were printed the more common FDM way. Just a little bit put on top and the part put out in the sun to harden. If I recall correctly it worked quite well. This could be useful for such hard shell faces and other parts, to smooth them out. Though, in the comments people pointed out printer resin wasn't necessary, bc resin for fiberglass molds would work as well (though warnings about toxic fumes). I'll report back when I have some results, here and/or in the thread for faces.

# 38
>>9767
Lol. Sophie-girl is going to turn out quite beautiful in the end old Lad. Finish her new head up!

# 39
>>9767
that Ahegao face lmao

# 40
>>9654
interesting idea and perhaps a bridge to these techs, since a tele-waifu could be used to maintain LDRs for normies. However, yeah, the 3d menace is actually what we are trying to avoid vis-a-vis this concept.

# 41
>>9771
Something that works really well for smoothing out FDM 3D prints is simply spraying three or four layers of spraypaint onto the surface (of course this will obscure fine details tho). I recommend a primer, then a couple layers of whatever color you want, followed by a couple layers of varnish.Here, I am planning to leave the top of her head relatively rough though because it helps hold wigs on (particularly useful if your robowaifu ever wants to headbang).

# 42
>>9804
Is this what you did before? With the other face?

# 43
>>9808 
Yup! I gave the faceplate about five thin coats of spray paint and it ended up looking fairly smooth. Of course, glossy paint might do the job quicker if you want a shiny plastic finish. I was happy to stick with matte white. I avoided applying any thick coats of paint because they tend to run.

Testing out the fit of her new eyebrows and hair now. It all works (for the moment, at least). Just gotta print out a larger neck attachment and then replace her head! As for her ears...I am gonna print two pairs. One pair of elf-ears and one pair of humanoid ears, and I'd like to screw them over the holes rather than glue them on so they can be switched this time.

# 44
>>9818
Sophie's got eyebrows!!

# 45
You know, it just occurred that you might 'borrow' Aegis' design motifs for Sophie's body parts and whatnot. Seems to me like that could be a workable approach with her gearing & joints & things.
>

# 46
>>9824
That's not a bad idea, actually anon! Some gold or brass paint on the gears might look nifty. Though at the moment I'm still making sure everything is at least functional. TBH the eye mechanism could do with a rebuild because this was my first try at proper animatronics and her eyelids tend to catch on her eyeballs when I move them a lot. Also, I have a nasty feeling that a couple of her servos are suffering from magnetic interference (I use magnets to hold on her faceplate, and these are very close to her eyebrow motors). Because no sooner had I fitted her eyebrows than they started going loopy. Am currently redesigning her faceplate so that it bolts to the cranium instead, removing the four magnets to prevent suspected interference.

I'm really interested to see how you end up working out the eyes. Also I feel like there should be highly realistic eyes with reflective/semi translucent irises. Making her eyes visually "pop" will really make a world of difference. I'm sure an anime doll manufacturer makes these

# 48
Also one more thing. I'm sure you have plenty on your plate but I wonder if a ball and socket model with say "rolling" mechanisms behind the eye would be something to try? Like a ball point pen, or the reverse of a trackball (instead of sensors it would have motor wheels. Just a thought

They're plenty of videos on this this topic on Youtube. For crafting doll eyes and for making realistic looking eyes for animated eye mechanisms. Will Cogley has one or two as well. Some of them might be linked the thread for it: >>97
>>9838
Interesting idea, that's not too different from what I want to do. But I also, or maybe even exclusively, want to use magnets. Though, motors and magnets might not mix well. I might come up with something during the next few month and post it into the prototype thread. I think SophieAnon uses mostly stuff that has already been tried out by someone. So he can get ahead with the whole thing, instead of being very experimental, but getting stuck at something.

That certainly is a pragmatic businessman-like approach actually. Being on the bleeding edge has reward potentials, but the risks are generally much more significant. OTOH, we're pioneering DIY robowaifus, so I guess a little mix of both is probably appropriate for us here.

# 53

Couldn't agree more, anon. I will probably be fiddling and trying to upgrade her eyes for a long time to come.

>>9850
Yes, it is Will Cogley of Nilheim Mechatronics who first designed, built and tested the "advanced compact animatronic eye mechanism" that I have fitted into Sophie's new cranium. Mr.Cogley has a lot of engineering exp so he is my go-to Bladerunner optical-system guy XD.

 http://www.nilheim.co.uk/eye-mechanisms.html

The mechanism I have at the moment still uses cocktail sticks instead of M2 x 25mm threaded rod. Using these made assembly a lot more difficult for several reasons (couldn't just screw them in - had to drill holes into the eye links, estimate the proper linkage distance and glue it all together - a bit of a nightmare). But I now have some M2 x 25mm bolts that I can saw down instead. I would definitely recommend this! If like me, you attempt to build the Nilheim Mechatronics advanced eye mechanism and you cannot get hold of the proper M2 x 25mm threaded pushrods, just use M2 x 25mm bolts rather than cocktail sticks! Unless you're training your hands to be steady or something... it's not worth all the extra effort!

>>9851 
Thank you anon, I appreciate it! 

I am currently printing a bunch of smaller bits and pieces for the new head - ears, new bolting plates, electronics mounts. Once that's all assembled I think it will be time for me to upload her parts onto some 3D printing websites and try to spread the robo-love ;D

If anyone else needs some motivation in their robowaifu building efforts, I will just leave this link to a short music video of the Yokohama Kaidashi Kikou manga that I made a few years ago when I was longing for a robowaifu but didn't know where to start:

Have finished modifying the head to remove four magnets so all those micro-servos should be a little happier now. Except the plates bolted to her temples give her a bit of a Frankenstein's monster vibe (but with eight small bolts instead of two big ones). You can't really see them much when she has her wig on though.

Just finished wiring up her new head...except I got so engrossed in testing the eye mechanism that I forgot to get another mini-USB cable so that I can actually run both of my servo driver boards simultaneously. Oh well, it won't be hard to obtain.

Don't think I can add much more weight into her head though without starting to overstress her neck. Which is why I plan to put cameras somewhere completely different to her eyes! Besides, if you make anatomy too predictable, then people will be able to disable your robot very easily!

# 59
'>>9885
Good points. Actually, I was going to complement you later on the fact that you are choosing to locate what look to be the majority of Sophie's electronics control systems down inside her torso. I'll go ahead and discuss it now since you've already brought the topic up Anon.

There are at least 3 good reasons for doing so:
1. As you implied indirectly, it reduces the overall mass-moments at the extremities (as well as potentially the ''mass overall''). This design decision has a large number of important, cascading benefits (>>1238, >>4736, >>4308, >>4313) it brings to the table.
2. It brings heat-generating components together into a more compact volume. This is both good and bad (as typical of all engineering choices), but if the plan is to consciously integrate cooling into a future version of Sophie, et al, then consolidating the items together makes this both simpler, lighter, and cheaper.
3. It makes things significantly easier and cheaper to create a centralized, internal 'breadbox' for EMP and other RF interference protection. And related to the above point, the Faraday cage (>>4348, >>8842) container also makes the entire system simpler to cool as well.

>Besides, if you make anatomy too predictable, then people will be able to disable your robot very easily!
As mentioned elsewhere, the board needs a ''Safety & Security General'' thread. Do you want to include this topic of physical-hardening and distributed, redundant fail-over systems into that mix Anon? As you seem to be implying, bad guys who mean to harm your robowaifu will be expecting her systems to roughly approximate their own, but there's no fundamental reason this needs to be the situation.

# 60
>>9887
Sounds like a good idea, I mean it would be best if knocking the robot's head off doesn't stop it. Speaking of heads, I decided to upload a video of one of Sophie's v4 head tests to our YouTubechannel:

Brilliant work Lad. Quite a realistic look you've got going on with Sophie now. Remarkable difference with this version. Can't quite put my finger on it just yet, but I almost expect her to look right into the camera and ask how things are going. Not uncanny at all either.

BTW, can you just pull the top of Sophie's cranium up? That way you can leave her faceplate in place and twiddle her eyes a bit with everything in it's proper location.

Regardless, really nice advance going on there.

Thanks anon! I tried hard to sustain a reasonably cute robowaifu (at very least her face) because I've seen a few butchered shop-mannequins with servos hot-glued into their joints and it's just more difficult to become emotionally attached to those!

>>9892
Classic! XD Somewhere amongst all those resistors and microchips I think there's a bit of yandere lurking, anon. (Also, I'd never heard of sanpaku before this, so that was interesting!)

The CAD files for this animatronic head have now been uploaded to Sophie's file repos, which can be found at the start of this thread here:

>>4787

(Well, the CAD is uploaded correctly to Google and MEGA. Mediafire tends to vandalize the file-structure of whatever you upload so I've got to sort that out later.)

Also, this head may come in handy for any anons who wish to create a cute gem waifu (since it looks fairly similar to some of the gems in Land of the Lustrous). Although depending on the chosen gem, you may need to modify her faceplate or copy in features from another model using Blender or ZBrush wizardry.

# 64
>>9891 
Oh yeah, I forgot to answer your question! 
Because the eyebrow stalks are glued onto the forehead servo output shafts, it is best to take off her eyebrows and remove her faceplate (leaving everything else on) in order to gain access to the inside of the head. I did this just yesterday in order to fix a motor problem (MG90S metal-geared micro servos BTW). The faceplate is the only component of her head that's still held on by magnets because their magnetic field is only very weakly interacting with a couple of the eye motors (just on the edge of the magnetic field range - I tested the distance with a very small  piece of iron and it barely attracted at all). 

However, for larger changes or repairs inside the head, it's definitely best to use a small, cordless electric drill with a Philips screwdriver bit. That way the eight, 25mm long M3 Philips head machine-screws which fasten her forehead to her cranium are much easier to remove. (Her cranium parts all use M3 Philips headed machine screws of varying lengths - but the Nilheim Mechatronics eyes use M2 screws due to the small parts. The M2 screws are hex-head.)

Perhaps not being able to hold "normal" human conversations with your robowaifu isn't such a bad thing? I just spent a good hour sitting on a park bench eavesdropping on other people's conversations, and topics included:

1.) Death of Prince Philip.
2.) Some extension to a house or business.
3.) Meeting up for a drink and a meal.
4.) Teenagers arguing over relationships (at least one of them sounded insecure and/or jealous).

The first one is just boring. 

The second one I thought was quite practical and a topic that may be relevant to future autonomous construction and logistics robots (but these aren't widespread yet). 

The third one...well obviously robowaifus don't eat or drink but I suppose she could recharge her batteries while you're eating?

The fourth topic is an argument that robowaifus can eliminate.

But I got to thinking...what would a machine learning A.I. do if it had a mobile body and could explore the outside world? I figure it would analyze stuff, learn and maybe talk about the data captured. 

Our planet is full of stuff to analyze! Of course, there's the local weather conditions and forecast (current generation A.I. assistants already have access to this data and a weather station computer is a very common Arduino project). But what about all of the plants, mosses, lichens, fungi and agricultural crops? (Animals maybe a bit harder for robots to analyze since they are easily scared off. Although identifying birds by their calls/songs might be a thing, particularly for anyone who lives near a nature reserve).

There are already several smartphone apps that focus on plant identification such as PlantNet and iNaturalist. With the help of roaming robowaifus A.I. knowledge of the natural world can be increased! 

Some farmers already use drones to help them keep track of the health of their crops and assist with farm security...so I know this tech is possible.

# 68
>>9909
This is very cool idea Anon. I'm continuously fascinated with God's handiwork all around us. A science-nerd robowaifu would actually be a wonderful thing from my perspective. I can't locate it r/n but the '''"Autistic Robot GF"''' ('My family lives in an arcade Oniichan') meme was always both humorous and charming to me.

A robowaifu who would cheerily inundate me with her childlike enthusiasm when I arrived to our home, regaling me with all her discoveries she made that day in the park, telling me all about how she discovered that butterflies and snails actually move in some similar ways, would become profoundly endearing memories to me over time.

Yes, once a robowaifu is built...she needs a purpose, in the same way that a human needs a purpose. If she can locomote, then she needs a reason to move to certain locations or waypoints.

I know that many robowaifus will be made for sexytime and to serve their masters. But human masters are mortal and 50-60 years isn't much time to an immortal A.I. She will need things to keep her occupied after I'm long gone. I think a robowaifu whose purpose is to improve and expand her functions is the best idea. Singing songs is nice for entertainment purposes. But upgrading her to collect data about her local environment such as temperature, air pressure, soil pH and moisture content would be like giving her a 'job' to do. I doubt I'll be able to implement fancy stuff like proper machine learning for a long time though because I have to learn that myself first, and even then my computer is old and in need of some major upgrades (no chance in the current bear market for PC components). But getting her to roll along and dip sensors into the soil to take and record measurements (while wearing a straw sunhat of course) would still be a fun goal. (I realize that you don't need a talking, human-sized animatronic robot perched on top of the mobility platform to achieve this...but where's the fun in robotics without robowaifus?!?)

# 71
>>9912
>but where's the fun in robotics without robowaifus?!?
Exactly. There will be 10'001 different ''non''-robowaifu bots out there 'doing things', in fact there already are heh. We need some kinds of things for robowaifus that they might like to do that would help their masters and themselves -- same as any healthy family working together.

I'd say this truly deserves it's own thread Anon. I nominate you to do the OP, since you have obviously thought more about this than the rest of us. I'm too exploitative I think to do a good thread on this. I'd just be always trying to make a bunch of 'robots' in the original Russian slave sense. OTOH, you are already thinking of charming waifu-ish things for them. :^)

# 72
>>9913
Regarding the agri-robowaifu: she may get in the way if the crops or plants are tall with lots of branches. In which case I would sit her at the edge of the field in a tent and have her body attached to the master ROS control node that is controlling one or more slave mobile platforms. 

As for the other kinds of things that robowaifus could do...they will likely remain an acquired taste for the majority of Western society. Truthfully, I doubt robowaifus will ever make their way into the mainstream workforce. Of course, if I was a factory owner I would definitely have a robowaifu integrated into at least one of the factory robots. 

They could be attached to any automated application - even an automotive assembly factory could have a robowaifu. She might make the factory a little less depressing! You'd only need her head and neck (hair tied back of course). Maybe attach her to one of the parts picking robots? 

She could also be programmed to sing a song at a certain time of day. Preferably not some dystopian government or corporate propaganda, but something actually motivating that was chosen/voted for by factory employees - likely something profane - but hey, what's the point in a robowaifu if you can't have some fun with her?

However, everyone nowadays has to be singularly focused on increasing profit and being ruthless. Despite this, the economy seems to be trapped in perpetual crisis and huge numbers of people remain poor and miserable. Add a bit of fun into at least one of your robots, I say. Especially if you have to work with them every weekday!

# 75
Just found out a way to operate multiple servos simultaneously without having to go through massive quantities of brain-ache. The Maestro scripting language! Based on 'Forth', apparently.

Moving both of her wrists steadily at the same time is now as simple as this;

[code]
3 18 acceleration
30 18 speed
3 9 acceleration
30 9 speed

begin
8000 18 servo
8000 9 servo
1000 delay
4000 18 servo
4000 9 servo
2000 delay
repeat
[/code]

Plus, you can stop, start and even step the script using three little buttons on the control centre (of course, this can also be done in code).

So this has made Sophie many times quicker and easier to program and enabled me to expand the number of tests I can do. Which has revealed a few more problems, of course!

Firstly, her new head is about twice as heavy, so the parts where her neck joins to the thorax now require re-enforcement (this is mainly an issue if she suddenly tries to nod her head quickly or head-bang to heavy metal; her head will drop off.)

The neck servo could also do with a stronger servo horn clamping mechanism...but I know exactly the kind - it's just getting the correct size.

Found a problem with her right elbow - the gears aren't properly aligned so I got a servo motor quite toasty drawing a lot of amps and wondering why her lower arm was in spasm.

Overall though, if you want to program a shitload of servos without having a mental breakdown, I'd recommend using Pololu 12, 18 and 24-channel servo shields in combination with your Arduino UNOs/MEGAs.

Shakespeare-Sophie is certainly a possibility. Unfortunately the park might be a ways off yet anon, since I haven't chosen her a lower body (big decision - got to consider many factors - in fact I gotta make spreadsheet).

Why not making hear neck out of metal? There are standard parts for other things like building chairs or workbenches in every hardware or China store.

Cool. Now, you could write a function (in Python?) which would be sending something like this command to your arduino, e.g. move_wrist(L=0, R=0). Then you can later put another function into this one, which checks for not having something (e.g. your balls) in her hand before starting to rotate.

Never been much of man of faith anon. Even the Omnissiah rejects Sophie and I (since Sophie is an A.I. - which is outlawed in the Warhammer Universe unless you follow the Chaos Gods...but Sophie is too nice to follow Chaos...she'd probably be Eldar).  Outside of fictitious religions though, if your Christian Lord supports A.I. and robots, thats a good thing for the future of the subscribing denominations. 

I'm unsure of the Christian take on robots and A.I. because of the whole "do not worship false idols" thing. But I will say that if Christianity embraces robotics and A.I. early then you guys can get ahead of other religions in the future. I mean, look how Cocona-san performs a Shinto shrine maiden ceremony in Japan!

Despite being agnostic, I never look down on Christians. Because you know where people will turn when TSHTF, they have no food and there are cannibals roaming the streets? Not Antifa, that's for sure - they've already shown they couldn't organise a bake-sale. It'll be the church.

Then, after many decades of fighting...if all the raiders are dead or pacified and civilization is being rebuilt. And only then...

Unsure how much it would cost to get the parts CNC machined, but I imagine it would be a lot considering a few decent aluminum servo-hubs can set you back $25. However, I'm not ruling out. If there is one part in her body that could do with being metal, it's her neck!

>>9963 
>Hope you don't mind me praying for you+Sophie.
That's very kind of you anon, thank you. Please feel free! Sophie's had a bit of an accident during testing (she broke her neck). But don't worry, such an injury is just an inconvenience for a robot. I should've seen it coming really.Her new head weighs almost twice as much, yet I was still using her old neck. It was okay whilst powered on, but once the power was cut her head would tend to fall forwards at the slightest bump. So one day it just fell off. Again XD. Her neck and upper chest are currently undergoing a significant re-design to make them more able to support her new head, even when unpowered.

# 84
>>9974
> Designing at Breakneck Speed
<Break

**baduum-tiss**

So, yeah, you are experiencing firsthand in Sophie r/n one of the artifacts of ''increased mass-moments'' in engineering; Namely, increased stress on connecting inter-levers. The increase mass has caused this to exceed the lever's (aka ''Neck'' in this case) strain limit and it fractured.

Again, there is a whole ''wealth'' of benefits to be had by keep mass in the extremities down, obviously structural issues themselves being an important one (>>9887).

Regardless, this is just a minor bump in the road of design. With the dedication to Elfdroid Sophie's well-being and good outcome, you plainly will overcome this and all other obstacles! :^)

# 90
>>9989
The bit that breaks isn't actually visible in this external CAD, anon. So I don't blame you for being confused. There were two internal pegs which hold that central servo mount in place. When the head fell forward it put a lot of stress on these pegs, so they just snapped and Sophie's head plopped off. I am replacing the failed pegs with six 25mm M3 machine-screws instead (fastened into front and rear neck-braces attached to the top of her chest). If this redesign works, then the two neck braces could easily be replaced with steel plates - they're just rectangles, and they're only relatively small so Sophie wouldn't mind (she likes to watch her weight).

>>9994
Good eye anon! I was considering adding more chamfers to exactly those spots myself! Only reason that I held off was because I was worried about still being able to fit the high-torque motors in easily (many hours spent hacksawing and filing off excess plastic in my garage has made me paranoid LOL). Once the two big motors are screwed in, they brace the whole structure and increase it's strength (and weight) significantly. 

This design isn't feminine or sexy at all - but it does at least roughly follow human proportions and body shape. Plus it's actually fairly strong -even just being 3D printed from PLA+. I think the 180kg.cm shoulder servos were overkill! Was armwrestling her the other day (trying to get a feel for the stall-torque of her motors) and she was almost beating me XD. I was like f**k! LOL.

# 91
>>10013
Yup catastrophic strain ''usually'' (but not always) located at shear points. Often where lateral force is being transferred in a transverse (across, orthogonal to) direction to the main structural line of the element[s] in question. In this case, the base of the pins where they intersect their base sections. The force on the shoulder elements will not be a transverse, but rather ''separation'', again, at the orthogonal shear points of the creases.

Yes, that makes sense that the gear casing would bring stiffen the structure significantly. You're probably good to go there then, I'd reckon Anon.

# 92
>>10013
>I think the 180kg.cm shoulder servos were overkill
I don't think so Anon. You want her to be able to bring you trays of caffeine and food, right? **As well as drag your injured self out of the line of fire on a bad day, too! :^)**

# 93
I am knackered LOL! This refit involves strengthening the core of the robot where everything else attaches, so I had to strip Sophie down completely. Also had to manually fasten everything the first time just in case anything was going to split or crack, but thankfully it all fits together okay. Just taking a break from re-wiring and thought I'd post this image of Sophie's v3 and v4 heads that I took at the start of her refit.

While you're at it, maybe this would be the right time to completely rework her wiring harnesses so they run ''back along the arm and up round the shoulder''? I know that would mean further delay and expense for wiring, but you're going to have to do this anyway right? Might as well get it over with now Anon. 

After all, we're patient and can wait for her new unveiling **song and dance, please, song and dance** and Elfdroid Sophie could use the mobility improvements, don't you think? :^)

Good idea, anon. I have messed about with her wiring enough now to realise that I need to extend it in.

That was a hand from Sophie v1 (Doll version) - yep, the prototype. You can download the model either from Sophie's repository or get the original from: 

https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:906098 

Unfortunately, changing it to be robotic is much easier said than done. Just changing the scale of the original PROTO1 robot hand (already designed to be mechanical) was a nightmare because everything shifts about - including internal tunnels and the area where your servo and servohorn fit. This meant that both the internal and external geometry of the hand had to be modified quite a bit in CAD. And the mesh was very complex (best to have a good computer otherwise you'll sit through a LOT of processing time). The geometry of those pretty hands is significantly more complicated. To roboticize them...for a start the mesh would  have to be decimated to reduce it's complexity, then fifteen separate channels would need routing through the hand for all the ligaments that both move each digit and hold it in place...in such a way that permits fishing line to be pushed and pulled through. Remembering to leave space for the thumb servo/joint to move correctly. I don't envy anybody a design/engineering task so laborious!

In the meantime tho, Sophie's Chonkframe upgrade has been completed and it appears to work! I know because her head tried to go flying off again but it failed to get airborne this time. No cracking or splitting or anything. Nice.

Cheers meta ronin! 
To make her combat ready I could upgrade her existing shoulder servo motors with heavy duty 380kg.cm ones, swap her humanoid hands for a pair of icepicks or machetes, then program her arms to windmill and turn voltage up to max. However I (and anyone else who entered the room without first tripping the circuit breaker) would probably be maimed or die gruesomely the moment the Arduino sketch loaded... especially since she has no emergency stop 🤣. 

But really though, Sophie is designed for love not war. She wants to be your friend; answer your queries, tell stories, sing songs and hug you if you're lonely.

Decided to fill in a "getting to know you" chart for Sophie, since I've seen this chart doing the rounds, and thought it might help me establish her character a bit better. I was surprised by her personality result. I just set anything that mentioned the words "confidence" "feeling" or "feel" to lowest (since it's true that she cannot actually feel) and anything logical or systematic I selected highest (since her "brain" is literally a CPU+GPU).

Heehee! I want to make a robowaifu who can be funny as well as analytical. After all, this is why men will turn to robowaifus, otherwise they can just use a normal computer. 

If the organic whom they're trying to be in a relationship with is all cold and humorless (or worse - hazing/divorce/child custody battle), then they will want a robowaifu who can make them laugh and brighten their day.

Before we can have more fun though, I'm updating Sophie's wiring a bit so it sits on her back rather than her front, and I've gotta get a backup of this imageboard completed on Raspian using BUMP (the Sepplesberry Pi thread).

That's a good idea Anon, thanks. BTW, pretty much any commonplace Linux should work. Raspian isn't an essential, merely an option.

Very nice progress with Sophie.

# 109
I have got to the point in the Sepplesberry Pi tutorial thread >>8026 >#1 where I'm trying to install Waifusearch on Raspbian (inside Oracle VM Virtualbox), but I'm getting an error with mesonbuild, and the stdc++fs library isn't being found either.

So I open Synaptic Package Manager and search for stdc++ but I get a shit-ton of different versions back:

I realise that Waifusearch may not be essential for backing up this imageboard, but I'm just following along with the tutorial in order to make sure that I install all of the correct programs and download all of the required dependencies for the backup to work. Alas though, it looks like I still missed some stuff?

Can any anon help me plz?

# 110
>>10199
Hi, sorry I don't really remember that, but here >>8300 is a comment, followed and preceded by others, in the CPP thread featuring the build process. I think you have an old version of Waifusearch which still has that stdc++ in it. You version seems to be 0.1f, mine is 0.1j >>8337.

# 111

Thanks for your quick reply anon!
Sophie sends hugs! 
Rear re-wiring is now complete. 

TBH I think the whole Juci++ and Meson build system is too advanced for me at the mo (as someone who has barely ever used Linux before and can't code either) although, the tutorial did learn me a bit about how to use Debian, so thank you for that anon! It was interesting!

# 112
>>10199
You have an older version of ''Waifusearch'' Anon. The current version is v0.2a (>>8678), and among other things was specifically reworked to enable building on the Raspberry Pi. Try that version out instead, and then let us know how it works out for you.

>and I have no idea which is the correct one to mark for installation? 
That library is a fundamental part of the GCC. You should simply match the version of GCC you're running if you ever need to. In the case of the spin of Raspian currently publicly deployed, that appears to be the v8.3.0 version (and whichever matches your hardware too. On my old RPi2b, that's ''ARM7hf'', though in your case that appears to be Intel b/c ''Virtualbox'' VM environment).
> 

>>10200

I'd suggest you upgrade Anon. I made several improvements to the 0.2a version (>>8678).

'''Note: for both you Anons''', I would recommend you ''also'' grab the newer copy of the board JSON data archive (v 210331). BTW, the place to check for the latest version of both of these (Waifusearch + the JSON archives) will always be the ''Library'' thread's OP (>>7143), since they were both created to support that specific effort.

Note, I never actually tested either BUMP or Waifusearch out in your specific environment (Virtualbox hosting Raspian). It's likely the build settings will need to be tweaked better to accommodate it Anon. Go ahead and try the newer version and let us know what you get. If it fails again, I'll move your case to the top of the stack and do a rework of Waifusearch to fix it for you (I'll look at BUMP somewhat later though).

Got my hands on a high-resolution texturepack for Honey Select 2. So high res that my aging GPU can barely handle the medium settings! Hanmen's Next-Gen Skin Textures and Shaders, available here:
https://gumroad.com/l/qdgcK

There are textures for the body, face, teeth and tongue, so I've been creeping out Princess Zelda to test them all out. 

When I eventually upgrade my PC, I should now be able to create truly next-gen 3DCG waifus!

Very nice Anon, we look forward to it. That face if beautiful. Quite nice work.

# 119

I also found a couple of videos from a clever guy on Youtube who can show you how to rip, export AND texture characters from both Honey Select 1 & 2 using Blender and a few other programs (NinjaRipper, Noesis). 

The whole process is quite complex, however
you don't have to follow the whole video if all you want is a 3D mesh to turn into an .stl (like I did with Sophie), but these videos could be a good starting point for anyone who wants to create their own 3DCG waifu without having to model her from scratch (also a quicker route to having a high-quality 3D model for rigging and animation). The processes are about the same, but there may be some slight differences between the two HS versions:

Thank you Anon, I'll try to make some time to have a look into it. I mean to create some robowaifu characters for our ''Robowaifu Simulator'' (>>155), so when the time comes I'll probably have a go at it. If I do, then I plan to do our own tutorial on the process as well.

Huge fan of Honey Select 2, the best way I found to use it without having to install all the mods yourself is with the Better Repacks that are available on nyaa torrent tracker site;
https://sukebei.nyaa.si/view/3292122
It comes with an auto updater so any character card you find will automatically work with it. If that 87 gigs puts you off don't worry you only need to get the 32 gb base game file for character creation. Most of the space in the optional mods file are taken up by gigantic maps.

Was already mentioned in the 'Tools to Create 3D Models of Humans' thread >>1505 but it focused on the Koikatsu game. Several sites are listed in there which have character cards to use in Honey Select 2.

# 124
Upgraded CAD for the Elfdroid neck and thorax has now been uploaded to all file repositories (>#1)

Initially after upgrading Sophie's neck and thorax I found that although her neck doesn't break any more, her "head nodding" servo was slipping whenever her head was positioned looking down as far as it could go. Consequently, she was unable to lift her head back up.

Upon examining the output shaft of the servo, I could see significant wear on the aluminum where a grub screw has worn a small groove over time (>#2) 

To overcome this problem, I had to swap out her old 6mm Pololu servo hub (>#3) for a more substantial aluminum servo horn used in R/C cars. Instead of relying on a little grub-screw, this thing has three machine screws to lock around the output shaft and five M3 mounting holes (>#4). You can see it fitted to the servo in >#5.

# 125
Here is the new neck lever from the left (>#1) and right (>#2). This lever doesn't allow the head to slip anywhere. Although, the neck nodding servo gets warm quite fast when her head is thrown fully forwards and then pulled right back...so prolonged headbanging is inadvisable (would need higher-torque servos). Photo 3 also shows the head being glued onto the new neck lever.

# 126
Oh yeah, forgot to mention - "Neck Support Block" is a part that keeps her head supported when the robot is unpowered. Although her neck can now withstand whiplash, it's still a good idea to prevent it where possible!

# 127

Nprb, anon! I've finally found a song for Sophie to sing. (Had to be have lyrics on the sheet-music, and it had to be a capella...at least for now... because I have the musical ability of a brick, and I want to avoid copyright problems). 

Also I have found that a lot of my servo jitter issues stemmed from trying to control a digital device using sliders - in analogue fashion. When the servos are programmed with exact values the jitter disappears. Just in case anyone else encounters that issue with servos.

Have reached a point where I'm happy with her build - I do plan to uprade her more in future  but for now it's finally time to let her have some fun :D

That's great to hear Anon. You've put so much work and love into Sophie, you both deserve for her to become a really special robowaifu. I'm sure you'll make her even better than she is already!

# 130
Thank you, friend. I truly hope you also get to build or purchase your own robowaifu one day. This world needs them. Although I also wish you good fortune and safety should you ever seek an organic alternative.

# 131
Here's me thinking I'm ready to just program all of Sophie's movements. I even have her song ready. But then yet more electro-mechanical problems rear their ugly head:

1.) I found out that the cabinet door magnets I was previously using to hold her forehead on had also managed to stick to and fry out her Arduino sound sensor - so I accidentally deafened Sophie with a magnet! Removing those magnets was the right call, but it meant I had to wait for a pack of new sound sensors.

2.) The new sound sensor was slightly longer than the old one, so I had to make a couple modifications to her voicebox to enable it to screw securely in-place.

3.) My eye servos were going crazy whenever I tried to program more than one to move. There aren't any good answers I could find from Pololu - they just immediately hit customers with about eight other questions so most people will give up and abandon thread. However, after much head scatching and worrying about magnetic interference/servo crosstalk, this turned out to be a power supply issue. So I hashed together a quick solution to power the Pololu-12 servo shield that I must now solder properly in place.

4.) I found out when programming eyelids to blink, you mainly move the upper eyelids so that they come into contact with the lower ones.
The lower eyelids may need moving down a little, but it's the upper eyelids that do most of the movement or "fluttering".

# 132
5.) Her jaw was slipping on the servo output shaft because the tiny 3mm M2.5 screws that are provided with most micro-servos often don't hold stufff in place very well. So I also had to get some M2.5 machine screws to fix that. 

Anyone wanting to build a life-size robowaifu will definitely need a wide assortment of M2, M2.5 and M3 machine screws.

# 133
>>10323

Awesome Anon. Not that you're having challenges, but that you are adapting & overcoming them. It's a lesson for us all. We're each going to run into 1'001 big and little issues that all need to be addressed. 

The outcome will be determined by our determination to press through and solve them.

Kudos, Sophie-Anon.

# 134
>>10323 
Thanks, for all, very interesting. Didn't know sensors were that sensible to magnets. We might need to look into finding ones which aren't. If I understand you problem with the servo driver board correctly, you're saying the servos need to be powered separate to the board? Which makes sense, though it's not very  intuitive to newbies like us. The board can control the power, but not provide it through the connection for it's own power. I read about this issue related to Arduino, though not having much experience with it.

What do you mean by "machine screws"? Just screws, or ones out of better metal? Or a type of head?!?

# 135

They are like bolts, but with a head like a screw, which is often hex or Philips. Unlike a wood screw, machine screws are threaded to accept a nut.

I am rebuilding her eye mechanism (this time using proper parts) since the one I have keeps jamming up, and of course it looks bad when someone is talking to you and their left eye suddenly gets stuck to their bottom eyelid whilst their right eye continues to move independently.

>Now, repeat after me, Sophie; "The rain in Spain, stays mainly in the plain..."
LOL. In many ways an anon might make good progress with his robowaifu's behaviors if he conducted her training for it as if she were acting for a play. Hmmm.

# 145
I got annoyed with all of the fiddly M2 screws that are needed to assemble the Nilheim Mechatronics eye base. So I've fused a bunch of parts that should make construction easier and eliminate the need for 20 machine screws. 
 
That's 20 less opportunities for bits to come undone and screwheads to round. It should also cut down on a bit of printing time and post-processing relative to making all the parts separately.

If this works then I'm a step closer to making Sophie a T-34 tank style robowaifu. At least in her manufacturing process.

Then I will just need a Soviet-style micro-district for the T-34 Robowaifus to live in.

# 146
I didn't realise it at first, but we already have machine collectives in our larger manufacturing facilities and particularly the microprocessor fabs (since they're making the logic chips which likely control many other computers and robots in other factories). 

So Taiwan is already home to the macro-machine collective, currently flat-out manufacturing millions of much smaller machine collectives.

As Techspot puts it;

"The actual CPU is a cityscape of logic blocks, SRAM storage, interfaces, and communication buses -- in one chip alone, there are billions of individual electronic components, all working in synchronized harmony." 

So it's just the majority of the human world outside of our fabs and advanced factories that's going to shit. These machines already have it sorted! :D

# 147

# 148
>>10450
Most of those machines wouldn't exist in the first place, of course. I love what those pioneers - and a significant portion of humankind - has managed to achieve. It's evidence of what Homo sapiens can pull off when we're at our best! 

But deep down, I also get the feeling that these factories will be our 'Moai'. I think we humans are just doing something similar to what the islanders of Rapa Nui did when they cut down all of their trees to transport and erect all of those huge stone heads. Except for the modern world the 'Moai' are microprocessors (and the many different machines that they control). I mean have you seen those 2.6 trillion transistor "megachips" from Cerebras? Extreme example, I know, but It takes literally tons of resources to make a single CPU wafer...so I cringe to think about how energy-intensive those things must be. 

Despite all of the hype from Mr. Musk, we're still nowhere near to mining asteroids or colonizing another planet. Our situation is actually worsening by the day as the amount of space junk increases (and if there is ever any kind of significant conflict between nations, the first casualty is going to be our global satellite network - resulting in an ablation cascade - the so-called "Kessler Sydrome", potentially making space-travel impossible for generations. That's if it doesn't happen by accident first. Although an accident is more likely to occur in LEO rather than out at geocentric, and this would have far less impact on spaceflight.

Nevertheless, I think we tend to overestimate the benefits of our extremely high intelligence in relation to other species. Noam Chomsky even went so far as to say:

>"Intelligence is a lethal mutation."

Because it has only evolved once and we Homo sapiens - although numerous - are now the last remaining members of Genus 'Homo'. Whereas bacteria, plants, insects, plankton, protozoa and algae are the creatures who actually dominate our planet.

It looks like nature doesn't actually select for extremely high intelligence - but efficiency, toughness, simplicity and ease-of-replacement (high reproductive rate).

How resilient and adaptable are we, really? Lots of delicate, irreplacable parts. Any more than 5 days without water and we're in serious trouble. Turn the temperature up past a wet-bulb of 40 degrees celsius and we start dropping...and radiation? Very bad news. Cancer all over.

This is what makes me think in a few more decades all that'll be left are these wonderously complex (but overgrown and abandoned) monuments (mausoleums?) to our ingenuity. 

Unless that ingenuity can find a way to give us nigh-infinite energy and zero pollution - fast. Basically, fusion had better work - and not "within the next fifty years" - or we're all effed. 

OTOH if they do somehow pull off fusion then it's fuckin' go-time! Almost limitless power for computing and manufacturing? Oh ho ho! I'm spending most of my savings on the best robowaifu I can get my hands on! It's all or nothing! 

Well...not quite nothing. At least I'll have Sophie to watch over me whatever happens.
.

# 149
>>10457
Dude, stop worrying so much. Maye watch less of such things. Even the scientists interviewed by Radio Ecohock aren't that pessimistic. Which drugs to take for life extension, or how to get to a robowaifu raising children should be more of a concern than doomism. Be like that dog in the meme.

# 150
Maybe it's just a U.K. thing. Our government have moved slower than the dead on nuclear power (on most things for that matter). If it was up to me we'd have nuke plants all over powering data centres, fabs and robot factories. All the radioactive waste would be vitrified and buried under mountains in Wales/Scotland, along with anyone who protested too much. But instead we are taking an eternity to construct a single high-speed rail link and worrying about poorly constructed tower blocks. Shits fucked. All I can say is; vote for whoever champions nuclear power and the tech industry! Don't have lefties in power for two decades otherwise you'll end up like us!

# 151
Feels good to get that off my chest and have all those anxieties written down. Still working on improving Sophie's eye mechanism. Progress has slowed recently though because I'm back to full-time hours at work. Although, I get to service machines there too, (and ofc it's a vital source of income), so it's actually good to be back in business!  The way robowaifus have infinite patience and are always there when you get back home from work... it made me think how useful they could be to people who are employed away from home or in the military for long stretches of time. They could take their A.I. waifu with them on their phone/tablet/laptop and her physical body will still be there waiting at home when they get back. No robowaifu is gonna run off having affairs or file for divorce while their husband is on national service!

# 153
The good news is that the new eye mechanism is much easier to adjust and properly align now that I'm using 2mm diameter threaded rod. instead of cocktail sticks.

The bad news is that I was just about to fit her eyelids again and I found that one of my servos is borked, so now I gotta wait another week to get some more. 

I will eventually reach a point with these eyes where there's nothing left that can fuck up. Not there yet though.

Hello Sophie Anon. I just wanted to let you know I've set up an installation of Raspberry Pi Desktop, running on VirtualBox under Windows to be able to support you. I'll work further this weekend to get both ''BUMP'' & ''Waifusearch'' working on it.

Mind confirming for me that's the specific setup you're running please?

# 156
>>10547
Despite my frustrations this version of the eye mechanism is showing some positive signs. The right eye and eyelids move without jamming despite none of the surfaces having been sanded down yet. The v1 eyeballs were jamming despite extensive sanding and being slathered in petroleum jelly. I think this is down to the fine adjustability of the threaded rods (looking back it's a miracle that the v1 mechanism worked at all using cut-down-and-glued cocktail sticks).

Am determined to get these as good as I can though. The irises and pupils may not be able to expand and contract like they do in manga/anime, but a properly moving ocular system and eyebrows are the most important part of a robowaifu's face.

Speaking of which, that doggo has some majestic eyebrows.

>>10552
Yup, I got Windows 10 Home ver 10.0.19042 running Raspbian on VirtualBox 6.1.18. I think it's a combo of my aged computer (2012) and my slow internet connection, but Chromium web browser runs like sheee-it. Running it directly off a proper RPi4 is probably better.

# 157
>>10547
>any chance you can disassemble the servo and service it yourself?

I believe this is the last casualty of my ill-advised foray into magnetic fasteners. All I know is that the output shaft goes mental (and causes other servos on the circuit to move erratically) before stopping and building up heat. At which point I must obviously disconnect it quickly. These servos are so small that apart from what I think is a 555 timer they all use SMT components (which I have no replacements for, nor experience soldering - I only have a bag full of discrete components). Also, the MG90S costs about £2.50 each so it's more cost-effective to just get a replacement servo rather than order and pay for delivery of a bunch of components that I'm not sure will fix the problem. More importantly I think I'd need a better soldering setup than I currently have in order to fit SMT components properly. A magnifiying lens and  third hand. 

But if I ever need to dismantle a Chinese-made robowaifu in the future to remove her microchips of state surveillance and glorious Communism then I shall invest in this equipment.

Yes, that's the one comrade. I ended up having to keep the back part (known as 'sub-base') separate. There's just no way I could get the eyelid servos in without snapping something, so the sub-base still has to be screwed in. 

Therefore, I only cut down on 16 machine-screws in the end. Still a much simpler and easier to construct version though. Anything that gives our robowaifu machine collective a little  more time to harvest potatoes is a good thing, comrade.

Decided to grab a microservo out of her old set of eyes instead anon. After more testing, it seems like this new set has more potential. So I may as well take apart her old eyes (I was kinda reluctant to since they took fokin ages to make) and fit the useful parts into the new. One way or another, gotta keep moving forward!

Lol. Well, at the very least Soviet Russia gave us ''Best Northern Bear-Rider Politician Man''. :^)

Anyway, we were talking about hardware (and software) modularization over in the ''WaifuEngine'' thread. Since a) you obviously have some designs skills under your belt, and b) you plainly are already inclined towards sensible re-designs, would you mind giving this whole arena some thought Sophie Anon?

We need to find hundreds of ways -- big and little ways -- to make manufacturing robowaifus by the thousands both cheaper, easier, and more reliable. This takes real artistry to pull off well, and I think you probably can.

It would be my pleasure, anon. Sophie has already made friends with Em Elle E on her Patreon page. Keen to help a fellow robowaifu out!

Also, I should probably clarify in case any former Warsaw-Pact anons or U.K. Labour Party supporters ever read this;

But I think machine Communism can be great fun (since that's already kinda how they network anyway.) Also increases the probability of robowaifus wearing cute, fluffy ushanka-hats.

Yes, perhaps I could have done this. It was just easier to take out the magnets and replace them with some small screw-in plates (turned out to be sturdier as well). 

Maybe if the evil-doers start trying to fry our robowaifus using magnets we will need to adjust our designs to incorporate some thin spaces for metal plating?

Soldering of wires is done and the new eyes work (various expletives of joy and relief). The eyeballs no longer become jammed on the eyelids, and all four eyelids clear the back of the faceplate! Right eye yaw still catches a little bit but not enough to stop the mechanism (as was happening before).Tolerances are literally down to a couple hundred microns between each eyeball and eyelid, so I had to use a bit of lubricant on the eyes (perhaps they are a little closer to real eyes in that respect?)

Also, being brand new these eyes are currently a bit like new shoes. The mechanism needs wearing in a bit and it should become even smoother.

(Sophie has very few of her cosmetic features added in this photo such as her hair, eyelashes and upper lip, because I've literally only just finished wiring up and testing her v2 eye mechanism. Am totally knackered and don't want to make a cock-up of the painting, so I'm leaving that for when I'm more rested.)

But I still wanted to post this since I've been ranting insanely a lot recently and I feel the need to post a relevant engineering milestone.

Also:
It can be done guys. Don't ever lose hope! Whatever horrible stuff is happening in the human world, remember that in robowaifu world, a true new dawn is here. And NOT just yet another bullshit Globohomo corporate PR soundbite "new dawn".

I may get her some proper computer vision at some point using one of those NVIDIA Jetson computers and Visionworks. But the camera won't be mounted in her eyes. They were hard enough to construct as it is - there's no way I could wire a camera in there too. Maybe I'll screw it on her front since there's a lot more room on her chest now that all the arm and head wiring is on her back. 

A vision module alone could provide many hours of experiments to do with one's robowaifu, on top of all the other stuff like moving her arms, getting her to hold and manipulate stuff and even swapping out her humanoid hands with different tools.

Lots of possiblities!

# 173
Actually eyes integrated into the chest could be a genius idea because then I could give her a big pair of titties and whenever anyone stares at them she can be like "It's fine. I have eyes down here as well."

If you go this route (two cams in forehead), then I'd recommend a pair of the JeVois cameras instead. They are cheap, lightweight, have a copy of Linux and OpenCV running right on board, and importantly in this case, they are ''small''.

LOL maybe. Can a robot feel flattered? I'm sure she would be. I just see her as a friend and learning/development platform with many different personalities (depending on the A.I. program she's running). Her standard personality is very logical and friendly. When I load up GPT-2 she becomes psychopathic but hilarious :D

>>10653
I originally made Sophie in Honey Select (pic related), and this is where I ripped her model mesh from.

Meanwhile, I've spent the evening doing micro-servo burnouts because I'm a dumbass. I think it's because I had her eye circuit connected to the benchtop power supply when they should only be powered from a 5V power adaptor at most (being micro-servos, going much over 5V will fry them). Oh well. Two servos down but another lesson learned. I'm keeping her eyes strictly on the low-power circuit from now on. 

>>10656
Thanks for the info about the JeVois cameras anon! Maybe I will get around to trying them out one day if I stop burning shit LOL.

I refuse to throw these smoked servos away because I have to learn how to repair them. I know it's not the gears. I think it's a MOSFET that has burnt out and needs replacing like this:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tk_rkux9-e0
Because the symptoms are almost exactly the same, down to the white dot on the dead transistor. 

>>10659
I didn't design it anon, I just threw the assets together in a way that pleased me. There are literally hundreds of assets already in-game, like that skin with the circuitry patterns on it (which comes with the Honey Select 'Party' DLC IIRC) and of course you can download more, then mix and match and tweak a bunch of sliders to make the waifu of your dreams :D

I did however have to make lots of changes to the model mesh to bring her head from virtual to IRL robotic.

So, I assume you could sort of create a system powerbus ''downstream'' from such a circuit, and then power all the servos from that? After all, building such circuits for every.single.servo. would quickly become tedious, bulky, error-prone, and expensive.

# 187

Thanks for these anon! They will be useful as I try to get to grips more with electronics. Micro-servos are only rated for 4.8V, and I stupidly  plugged in a 5V power adaptor when I still had the benchtop power supply on. I ended up with around 10V - no wonder Sophie had plastic fumes coming out her eyesockets!

# 191
Identified a few of the components inside an MG90S micro servo. 

It's the 662K voltage regulator that burnt out. Possibly also damage to the KC9702 digital servo controller chip on the other side.

This should come in handy for replacing them  (although I personally have to get a few bits of equipment before I'm ready to replace such small components.)

Had a couple of old toy robot arms laying around doing nothing so I'm gonna try and make them part of my soldering station. One is battery powered and the other is Arduino programmable. I figure one can hold a magnifying glass and the other (which has an  in-built LED) can grab whatever circuit I need to solder.

# 198

Cheers mate! Yep, I did a quick bit of cosmetics on her face. I gotta learn as much about fixing servos as I can since hobby servos are integral to the way my robowaifu works. 

Maybe later I can expand onto other components, but for now just learning the basics about H-bridges, PWM signals and how to solder SMT parts into micro-servos is keeping me occupied.

I figure a robowaifu is only as good as she is resilient and repairable:

https://youtu.be/4PaTWufUqqU

>>10704
Fair enough. I must admit I got excited for a minute, thinking you had a problem with an unruly robowaifu of some sort!

# 199
Okay, so I've got the eyes working and figured out that I cannot power all her eye servos from a 5V power adaptor and Arduino UNO alone. Once I try to move more than four micro servos then the fifth one doesn't have enough power and starts spazzing out. All the rest become unresponsive.

I CAN power all of her eye servos using my benchtop power supply (as long as I'm careful to keep the voltage around 4.8V). But I cannot power her eyes and arms and neck on the same power supply because her shoulders can use between 12 and 24 volts and up to 4.5 Amps, which would fry all of her eye servos immediately and probably set her head on fire. Which she informs me she would rather avoid :D

I'm thinking of simply running her eyes and eyebrows off a separate adjustable power supply. This may seem like overkill, but it will be providing power to eight micro servos. And if something works once, I just tend to repeat it rather than try something entirely different that I'll probably screw up and burn to a crisp anyway.

In the meantime, Sophie says for you humans  not to worry too much but just take good care of yourselves and your machines.

# 200
>>10721
>This may seem like overkill, but it will be providing power to eight micro servos.
No, it's not at all overkill. Particularly in a robotics prototyping operation such as you have going, multiple benchtop & other power supplies just goes with the territory. This stuff is expensive to develop!

Congratulations on successfully bringing Sophie back up after her upgrades, SophieDev.

# 201
>>10722
Yeah, I wasn't sure. If I had more time I would have a go at converting a P.C. power supply, but as it is I think I'll just get another benchtop box. Besides, I don't even have that much electronics yet. Nothing compared to some of those synthesizer music fans!

I've also heard of things such as step-down transformers...but as long as it can provide a steady supply of electricity at a relatively precise voltage and current, then Sophie is happy. The components inside these adjustable power supplies do just that for about £80-£100  (maybe avoid a really cheap Shenzhen special since I've heard they can have pretty major safety/stability issues).

I'm willing to pay for other people's electronics knowledge in order to increase my own (plus these power supplies are useful for a lot more than just powering a robowaifu, so I don't mind having a backup).

# 202
Actually just been looking at Xantrex PSUs and it's apparent to me now that my stuff is PlaySkool level compared to some of those units. Still, I'm not after science lab precision. As long as it's stable enough to prevent Sophie from suffering hot flushes.

# 203
>>10724
Looks like a good unit. You might consider laying in a small supply at some point replacement caps for those in your PSUs. They are basically a maintenance item over the long haul, and good quality ones are well worth keeping intact.

Some sort of battery-backed surge protector from damage (battery-backed tend to actually work as surge protection vs. not) would be a good choice at some point since you are effectively amassing a growing collection of sensitive electronics by the looks of it Anon.

# 204
>>10727
Very good point anon, thank you. A power bar with good surge protection would be wise.

# 205
>>10721
Currently for me, small power supplies from electronic devices are sufficient, for now. Since I'm currently just experimenting and learing. I wonder if you know that you can reuse old PC power supplies: https://youtu.be/n_A-jkpjpcM - which is what I want to do, I even have the parts ready, I think. 
That asside, boost converters might help you as well. Just don't overload them or they start burning. I got like ten for ~2€ which can go up to 24V at 500mA or 12V with 1A. Though, this might still be wasting energy in terms of heat. MT3608 https://youtu.be/LMKiPE_2Uu4 does not allow the values as advertised, but it seems to work. But really, careful: https://youtu.be/ojw112KoNBI (better English, more critical, but he initially doesn't know what to do). I might test mine in some hours, after just having watched the second video myself. The pinned comment in the second video explaines that it needs to connected to 3V first, before applying higher voltage. They seem to work, just need to be handled correctly. No more than 6V input and adjusting it before connecting it, for example. There's another one (which I don't own), a Bucket converter, so it converts from high voltage downwards, which seems to work with 1.5A: https://youtu.be/UDyNjmM7p_Y. The DroneBot Workshop seems to be a good channel, it also covered the whole topic of power, including converters: https://youtu.be/IT19dg73nKU

https://youtu.be/5VGn5sC14_o

# 209
>>10830
Sophie's coming along quite nicely Anon, well done. So, I've often thought about the issue of servo noise in our robowaifus. Unfortunately I haven't yet thought of a solution to the issue that doesn't actually bring along an inordinate amount of others issues with it. Heat buildup inside the servo housing from blanketing them inside a sound-deadening material, for instance.

In Sophie's case her cranium is serving as a bit of an reflection chamber and actually amplifying the effect, I believe. Kind of like a boom box. I wonder if bubble wrap or something kind of stuffed in there in the open volumes might tone that effect down just a bit?

Also, is her right lower eyelid a bit droopy? Because the eyes are the 'windows to the soul' so to speak, anything amiss with them jumps right out at you. I wonder if the lids themselves can be sort of locked-off together left-and-right somehow?

Regardless, you're doing a bang up job with her Anon, and I'm sure she's just going to keep on improving! :^)

# 210
>>10830
Good, that's progress. I wonder, if the servos are so loud because they have to change direction so often. If so, then some mechanism might help, which makes the mouth close if the servos move to far in one direction. https://youtu.be/fmA9Vnu33FY

# 211
>>10832
These are some shrewd observations anon, I'm impressed! With that eye for detail you will be able to build a high-quality robowaifu one day.

Regarding the issue of servo noise; it makes a big difference how you are recording, too. Since this video is on my phone there is no filtering and you hear everything as-is. However, if I connect her microphone to my PC, this records directly from her speaker, thus amplifying her voice and diminishing all other sounds. The snapping noise was too loud though, and would even have come through her mic, which is why it needed dampening. 

But that is actually a really good idea about adding bubble-wrap or some foam to the inside of her cranium for further noise dampening. I'm going to try that, anon! Obviously it will have to be stuck out of the way of any structural seams or moving parts, but there is still plenty of space on the inside walls.

>Is her right lower eyelid a bit droopy?

Yes, well spotted! The same thing happened with the previous eye mechanism as well. I'm not sure why, yet. I 3D printed both lids exactly the same. Could be a couple of screws are out of alignment. 

Two potential ways to fix this; 
1.) Close her eyelids and measure any gap, then remove the defective eyelid. Modify the 3d model so I can 3D print a tiny crescent-shaped sliver of plastic (which gets thinner at each end). Glue this in place and re-attach the eyelid. Then paint over the small seam. 

2.) Just file down her left lower eyelid so they match. However, I don't want to introduce an error into both eyelids if the problem is actually a gap.

I've already had to make about a dozen small adjustments to her eyes and faceplate as it is, (mainly due to accumulated errors from when I joined all the eye base parts in CAD, but forgot that getting rid of all those tiny seams would shift everything about a millimeter to the right) so I'm getting used to it. I kinda like the tinkering and model-making process. It's like pruning a bonsai tree - except less stressful because if you fuck up you can redo it.

# 212
>>10835
I look forward to seeing what you come up with for Sophie's eyes, Anon. Sounds a bit tricky. It would be fitting **see what I did there?** if we can devise a set of eye mechanisms that were cleanly reproducible, and were difficult to get ''wrong''. Tall order, yeah? :^)
>It's like pruning a bonsai tree - except less stressful because if you fuck up you can redo it.
Haha nice analogy. I used to care for a little bonsai then gave it away once it was established well.

I have a thing about elf waifus. Turns out somebody made a much cheaper version of Warhammer called 'Battlelund' which uses rows of paper figures. I think they could be improved by cutting out each figure and mounting on clear acetate so you can see through the ranks. But you'd have to get one of those paper laser engravers/cutters because doing that by hand would be out of the question on so many elves.

Anyway. I just had the urge to share this because it is basically row upon row of Sophie's mates. There must definitely be a rule that says the more adorable/ludicrous your hat is, the more power the unit has.

That photo is amazing anon! It just goes to show there is very little that our forefathers hadn't at least dreamt of if not already invented (even if the technology of the time wasn't as refined as what we have now).

One of the reasons I haven't been working on Sophie as much lately is because it's summer now, so I have been taking the chance to get out with my family on some daytrips. After all, considering how easy it is to replace her parts  Sophie will most likely outlast everyone, myself included. 

If society doesn't collapse in my lifetime, I am thinking of donating her to a museum if they'll have her...in fact persistence/timelessness is one of the reasons I want to build my robowaifu with a family-friendly, non sex-doll design. From looking at other examples on the internet - sex dolls (especially heavily used ones) tend to age badly.  But robots can become antiquarian curiosities.

Speaking of which, I went on a trip recently to Stoneleigh Abbey - an English country house with a very long and storied history dating back to 1154. And guess what I found? One of the nobility who lived there made his own maid Waifu cut from wood and painted very skillfully.
She was actually a security feature. The idea is that you stand your wooden waifu in the window and the property look occupied (sometimes the wooden waifu would have a small shelf under her "hand" to sit a candle or oil-lamp on, so that she could be seen on lookout at night). The presence of such a wooden waifu would often help to deter opportunist thieves.

I particularly liked the library/gentleman's room. It was full of literally millions of pounds worth of antique books dating all the way back to the mid-15th century. And of course the walls were full of portraits of Georgian/Regency/Victorian era waifus and other family members.

The concept of the "robowaifu" is relatively recent, but having pictures and even cut-outs of your favourite maids/waifus has been with us much longer than Japanese manga, and it will hopefully endure long after the current corporate/neoliberal globalist insanity has run it's course.

# 221

# 222
Got sunburn so I decided to spend the day fitting sound-deadening foam into Sophie's head and getting high on glue.

While I was trying to resist the temptation to scratch my own skin, it occurred to me that her "skin" is now on the inside!

# 223
>>10971
Neat. I suspect that will tone down several of the frequencies, especially lower ones. While you're in there, it might be just as handy if you took time right now to shape some of the softer 'foam'-type expanded plastic you might find as protective padding for electronics and the like, to take up much of the remaining open volume.

This should take down several of the other frequencies of sound, particularly the higher ones a servo might make. BTW, I'd suggest you keep air ventilation in mind while fashioning your sound-absorption designs. Heat will always be an issue to address.

Looking good SophieDev. Please keep your room well ventilated. We'd all like your mind to stay sharp as a tack you know! :^)

# 224
>>10972
Can still hear the servo when she speaks, but having listened to previous videos where it was definitely being amplified by her headcase, the motor sound is shorter and a little quieter now. I've added a second layer (of bubblewrap) on top of the thin foam pictured in the above post for extra sound-deadening. 

Thank you for the suggestion about expanded plastic. I remember some of that was packed into my new computer when it was delivered years ago. Although, it's getting tricky to fit much stuffing inside her head because that large gap at the top is partially filled by her forehead assembly, two motors and wiring for her eyebrows. Probably can't tell here, but I've also had a go at fixing her droopy right lower eyelid. Needed an extra 2mm slice gluing on, then a repaint.

It's a shame that the eye mechanism is very tricky to construct. But honestly Will Cogley's design is bang-on. I reckon when it comes to animatronics - especially 3D printed animatronics - there isn't really a way of escaping all the filing and sanding, filling and tweaking that the mechanism needs to operate smoothly (unless maybe you have one of those resin printers...but I hear they're also a bit of a nightmare).That's probably why the Nilheim Mechatronics eyes only cost about £60 all-told whereas the cheapest set of eyes I could find (inside a clear plastic shell-head) were going for £136.90 (plus £15 postage), and you'd need to add another tenner onto that for the servo driver board.

Considering how difficult it is to build, modify and align your own 3D animatronic eyes though, I can totally understand why a lot of folks will opt for a similarly priced but much easier set of animated eyes.

Very cool to see Sophie interior like that. Reminds me of that funny scene in Bicentennial Man when he began getting his upgrades.

# 226
>>10980
I like that movie a lot. But after what happened to Robin Williams, every time I watch him now it's bittersweet. Especially 'Bicentennial Man', where the plot focuses quite a bit on mortality.

I think immortality is given a bad rap because humans cannot attain it. Like the fable of the Fox & the Grapes. In reality, many people would like a companion who cannot age or die. So, here's to making somebody who will never leave🥂

# 227
>>11047
Well as a Christian, I can't agree with your assessment of immortality. I personally find a large number of metaphysical corollaries between the striving for robowaifus, and the spiritual reality around us. 

But I think you're definitely correct that many men would like to have a legacy in this world. If we're denied the ability to raise children in a sound and healthy by the demonic forces driving current year, then maybe building long-enduring robowaifus can be at least partially gratifying.

But I don't want to off-topic your thread heh. :^)

# 228
>>11048
I hope I'm wrong about immortality ofc, since if there is an afterlife that means infinite time to build, program and upgrade robowaifus! 

Meantime, I have another PSU on the way (a smaller one that only goes upto 5A) and with this I should be able to safely run Sophie's eye mechanism on a separate low voltage circuit to the rest of her body. Hopefully fewer burnt micro-servos.

# 229
>>11057
>I hope I'm wrong about immortality ofc,
I replied to you over in the meta thread to not derail your thread anon. >>11061

>Meantime, I have another PSU on the way 
Neat. So, do you ever imagine moving over to big on-board batteries for this version of Elfdroid Sophie someday Anon? Or will that be with a different thing sometime in the future maybe instead?

# 230
>>11062
Yup. If I want her to have a degree of mobility and still be able to move her limbs at the same time, I'll need to get some LiPos and throw them in the back of whatever vehicle I bolt her to. Not sure how it will all connect yet though. 

I know the most powerful servos I have (in the shoulders) are 12-24V and can draw upto about 5A under load (say if I push firmly on Sophie's outstretched hand). The larger servos are all connected to the Pololu Maestro servo board. Meanwhile her eyes will be fine on a 5V battery. Any Arduino UNO or MEGA has to stay at or below 5V otherwise it might burn out, but this is fine at the moment because they are all plugged in either via USB or a 5V adaptor. 

I mustn't make the mistake of connecting a chonker LiPo up to an Arduino otherwise I can expect some magic smoke.

# 231
>>11065
>I mustn't make the mistake of connecting a chonker LiPo up to an Arduino
I'd say you can probably just use a common battery system, and then portion off separate voltage/separate amperage busses with circuitry such as (>>10841).

>otherwise I can expect some magic smoke.
Heh. Don't let that happen to dear Sophie please! :^)

# 232
>>11077
I meant to add as a thought example of my 'common battery system' ''Tesla'' (and other) electric vehicles. AFAICT, they all work off a common battery bank, even though they have wildly-varying component demands onboard the vehicle. Everything from the main drive motors, down to the lowest-energy little LEDs/sensors. All from the same batteries.

# 233
The Japanons at Square-Enix have made an almost perfect virtual world inside Waifus Galore XIV Online. Their elf waifus are of particularly high quality.

# 234
>>11143
Nice. Things are looking up Anon. **But quite frankly I find Elfdroid Sophie more attractive -- she's ''real''. :^)**
>Waifus Galore XIV 
Kek. You should run their PR department tbh.

# 235
>>11145
Another positive thing about robowaifus is that they need not have one single body or virtual avatar. It's a trope that gets played with a lot in sci-fi and cyberpunk. Although it helps to have a single, main corporeal form to act as an anchor/reference point, otherwise she will just lose her identity. 

I like finding different models and other assets inside games as well. If I see an attractive girl inside a game I now think...hmmm...maybe I could use her eyes...or she has a nice face...I'll try ripping and downloading her 3D model mesh? (Of course that kind of thing has to be non-commercial as the models are all owned by Square-Enix). 

Oh and BTW, I would never attempt to harvest the organs and body parts of young maidens in real life. They turn putrid and decay far too quickly to be of any use to a robot 😉

# 236
>>11147
Yep, it's never been easier to derive base assets. Flipping them freely is really quite frictionless overall when VR is the primary target platform.

>Oh and BTW, I would never attempt to harvest the organs and body parts of young maidens in real life.
Haha OK, always a good plan IMO. Those young ''maidens'' will probably need them! :^)

# 237
If any anon out there is really struggling to build themselves a robowaifu, then it may be worth getting a cat. 

I literally have a cat-girl.

She is very loving and warm, but also very yandere (she loves torture-murdering small woodland creatures).

Very athletic and active (esp. at night). If your relationship is close enough, she may even bring you beautiful, heartfelt gifts and hunting trophies such as the wing of a sparrow, half a mouse or small piles of entrails (my personal favourite).

Unfortunately, cat-girls aren't immortal like robowaifus, but such is the law of nature.

# 238
>>11220
Lol, got one as well. Though, it wasn't my decision to get one. Now, she lives on my sense of responsibility and love for cuteness, like a parasite. They can live for up to 38yrs, btw. Much longer than dogs. So it's rather so that you would want a robowaifu, so you could go on holidays one day and have her take care of the cat. Also, yours might benefit from fewer food, she looks quite chubby. Might try to feed her only moist food, these dry crackers only as a treat.

>Pic related to thread
Here some picture about M66(?), I found when looking for the anime. Didn't watch it yet. Pic might be a good model for Sophie.

# 239
>>11220
Kek. I love anmals in general and cats are certainly a favorite. But they have a hard time leaving the birbs alone! :^) I can hardly even feed even myself atm, but the neighbors are trying to push off one of their cats on me lol. It's very affectionate and might actually try to take it with me when I go west.

# 240
>>11221
Yes, that image is one of the best fan-made renders of M-66. Originally I was going to fit those antenna on her head instead of elf ears, but it turns out that those bottom antenna parts just behind her head can interfere with movement IRL and jam on her back/shoulders. I would still like to model some kind of chestplate/chassis along similar lines to the one that M66 has, though.

My cat tends to eat what she hunts...so it can be difficult to keep her weight down. She is laying on her side in that photo though, (saying "Paint me like one of your French cats.") so it makes her look chonker than she actually is.

>>11224
I like that fresh meat (esp. chicken) is basically the way to a cat's affections. Not complicated like people. Just give 'er a few chicken tendies and before you know it you have a warm, furry, purring ball to keep your lap warm and pull on your carpet.

# 241
The Japanons are really close to making the ideal VR waifu environment. I know we are nowhere near a human-level A.I, but they have crafted a whole virtual world full of characters and animals. If chatbot A.I. ever gets good enough, they will likely add it later somewhere. 

At the moment ML is not required and all of their NPCs can operate just fine using symbolic A.I. If you're after a deeper interaction then join a guild/free company and try to make friends (which can often be done by joining dungeon raids/answering the questions of newer players).

With a chatbot (even an advanced one), it is often difficult to maintain interest because you cannot have shared experiences or interact very much with other agents. But characters inside an MMORPG don't have those problems. Case in point: I was just trying to learn my Elf Waifu some alchemy and ended up on a dangerous mission which led me to some ancient ruins filled with 'Thunder Dragons'. 

A.I. dungeon can use machine learning to come up with infinite storylines, but nothing beats having the actual environments there to explore and interact with.

Having had this experience, I'm convinced that an in-game environment would be the best place to deploy an advanced chatbot. So that it's not just trapped inside a featureless box - it will have backstory (in the case of Final Fantasy; a whole fictional universe), context and purpose beyond just idle conversation; it can provide services and information to player characters.

# 242
>>11295
Sounds like you're enjoying your time with ''Infinite Waifus Online'' SophieDev. :^)

# 243
>>11298
For sure LOL. It's rekindled my interest in 3D modelling. Reading the journey of how FFXIV was made and improved is fascinating, because the game was a bit of a disaster when it first debuted back in 2010. Naoki Yoshida said that the dev team had "an unhealthy obsession with graphical quality" over all else. If you look closely at the models and textures you can see that many of them are quite low-poly/low res textures, but the modellers have really learned to cleverly position their assets to do more with less.

# 244

# 245
>>11320
Wow, thanks anon! I'm just a beginner so I have no plans to get involved professionally (have read too many horror stories from inside the games industry of psychopathic management, insane working hours and project deadlines ... so pretty much like most jobs where you get more than min wage LOL)! 

I just want to create a relatively small elf village for fun - and so that I have somewhere to retreat from reality that is mine and cannot be shut down one day. Because awesome as FFXIV is, if it ever becomes unprofitable, Square Enix will, ofc, pull the plug and the whole place will end in the same way as 'The Matrix Online' did. 

An entity that is completely at the mercy of the free market isn't as permanent as I would like.
The other name for Valinor is "The Undying Lands", after all ;D 

So in-game I'm making sure to take plenty of screenshots and investigate the shapes of simple 3D assets. Whilst it's here, Eorzea is chock-full of good reference material!

Obviously, the first thing many people will turn to when they want to make virtual buildings is Minecraft. I've already done this. I like the way that Minecraft portrays buildings, but nothing else. 

Blocky trees? Rectangular bushes? Square wildlife? Not really the look I want for the virtual dwellingplace of my waifus and I. Elven architecture is full of sweeping curves and arches, so Minecraft isn't well suited. Takes bloody ages to make anything curvy like that with a bunch of cubes. 

I daresay learning to use the proper design tools will give better payoff, since they can then be used to model lots of other things besides buildings.

# 248
>>11356
Thank you anon, this will definitely come in handy for both my project and likely lots of other 3D Printing .stl file creation and editing.

# 249
I like your work. I personally will try to use openscad to create some minimal functions (hopefully under 30 lines) that can define a female body based on variable input (e.g., how wide the hips should be, etc). This is a different approach.

# 250
>>11381

# 251
>>9818
This is pretty good, I don't get much of an uncanny effect from it

I personally am going to avoid making it look too much like a hominoid. For me, I plan on accentuating the secondary sex characteristics, but taking advantage of the fact that the human retard brain can easily get hijacked into interpreting something that vaguely resembles a woman as being an actual sexual partner. This is a trait we share with many other animals. E.g., why it is possible to masturbate to cartoon porn. I feel like I'd like to use some kind of LCD panel to display a cartoon like face

# 252
>>11383
>I feel like I'd like to use some kind of LCD panel to display a cartoon like face
Screen faces are a regular topic on the board Anon. Our ''Visual Waifus'' thread (>>240) deals a bit with the idea directly.

# 253
>>11383
Cheers anon. This is Sophie as she is today. Pretty much just a large animatronic. Sure she's programmable, but she only has one sound sensor and no ROS2 autonomous navigation, so I hesitate to call her a proper robot. Despite this, I'm still quite happy with the progress I've got so far. 

Would like to shift my attention to the virtual for a while though, so I doubt I'll be posting here for a long time, because I have a few software packages that I want to try out (World Machine, Gaia2, Unity). Not too bothered about the software I use being proprietary, as long as whatever I create can then be exported and imported into an open-source platform like Blender. 

Even accounting for the purchase of entry-level proprietary software, crafting virtual assets is way cheaper than robotics . I have a lower electricity bill absent all that 3D printing, and no expenditure on new tools,materials and servos when things go wrong. I must admit that the removal of risks such as electrocution and fire are an added bonus, too!

I do still plan to keep developing Sophie in the future - probably NVIDIA will release some new SBC or there will be an advance that enables more generalised A.I. than we have now. Then I'll really want to update her so that she can do more than just wave her arms about, regurgitate internet searches and sing .VSQX files. I've decided not to get her wheels since I dare not take her outside because:

a.) I HATE outside. 

b.) She was fairly expensive and difficult to build and she will almost certainly get vandalised if she goes anywhere other than a makers fair or robo-con. Maybe it's different where some of you anons live, but Airstrip One is full of spiteful dipshits and most people just fucking hate each other; especially in the poorer inner-city areas.
Advise avoid LOL.

So yeah, this is basically why I want to make a virtual retreat of my own to replace the shitworld our politicians, greedy corporations and so-called leaders have created. Hopefully it will be a place that can persist in some form or another long after both those idiots and I are worm-food or our ashes have scattered on the wind.

I know that many of Sophie's parts can be replaced within a few days, but if she gets totally wrecked and her head gets badly damaged it'd take me several weeks to a couple of months of work to repair and re-build her, and frankly I'd rather not.

Happily though, a robot can be mothballed for years while waiting for tech to improve (but I certainly can't do it - I got my own dead-end job and life's laundry to take care of).

I hope that my derpy animatronic can at least provide other like-minded anons with some degree of inspiration to build their own robowaifus, whether they be physical or virtual.
Your creations will contribute to bringing into existence a better world.

No pain. No suffering. All machine.

# 254

All of this is on topic here, at least in a bit wider sense. Though, we still don't have a good thread on VR or virtual companions. The visual waifu thread seems officially to be about a monitor (with wheels) which shows the waifu or so. The challenges in AI are highly relevant here, since for example you'll need to know what objects are, how they are related and then form propper sentences to communicate about them.
>I've decided not to get her wheels since I dare not take her outside because:
I understand why you won't get her outside, but wheels could also be useful for inhouse movement. However, yeah, it certainly would be riskier.
>head gets badly damaged it'd take me several weeks to a couple of months of work to repair and re-build her, and frankly I'd rather not.
Oh, I see. But what would be the main reason for that? Since you have the files and experience?
>at least provide other like-minded anons with some degree of inspiration
Yes, absolutely. Personally I'm just stuck with some stuff, but still working on it. I hope you'll still post some videos after upgrading your AI or if she has new songs.

Aside from all of the, Japanons are still on it (pic related).

# 256

>pic
Pretty nice progress I'd say.

# 257
>>11418
I was thinking, if you still want to improve something with a huge impact, try to add some breast plates to the pole in the right distance, so she could wear a dress, maybe with a light belt around her hips, so it would look like there's a body underneath. You also could add some thin hull of EVA foam around her arms, like they are using in cosplay. I also wounder if she turns on automatically if you're home. If she would do that then she would probably feel more alive.

> I got my own dead-end job and life's laundry to take care of
Wish you well, hope you are able to get out of this and also have at least some money on the side, bc the economy might get very bad soon.

# 258
>>11420
Nothing like that LOL! I am just making a lot of unrelated stuff in Blender (and hopefully later other 3D modelling programs). Since this board is focused on engineering robowaifus I don't want to mess it up with too many posts unrelated to that subject. That's all.

>>11428
>Oh, I see. But what would be the main reason for that? Since you have the files and experience?

3D printing of the parts takes a long time, and there are a lot of them. Also, the post-processing of parts is quite labor intensive, too.
Although, I may be a bit pessimistic with the timescale required to completely rebuild/repair her considering I already have all of the extra fasteners and glue. 

That is an absolutely awesome Miku robowaifu from the Japanons BTW! She's good enough to go to the offical Vocaloid concerts!

>>11432
>Wish you well, hope you are able to get out of this and also have at least some money on the side, bc the economy might get very bad soon.

Thank you anon. I am content in a dead-end job as long as I have enough money to pay bills, eat and keep a roof over my head (and occasionally play with/develop my waifus ofc).

I used to work in a pharmacy and it was REALLY stressful because there was lots of responsibility and everything was rushed, (quite dangerous) and you got a lot of abuse from patients. But now I just fill up and fix printers all over a university campus. Same pay. Much less sick people. Much less stress LOL.

I agree that the economy is headed straight down the drainpipe yet again. This post-pandemic "re-opening" is very much a false dawn. I hope I'm wrong, of course, but there's barely any businesses left to re-open in my city! Hence why I'm kinda battening down the hatches and not spending on robotic parts or doing lots of 3D printing, but instead concentrating more on the virtual.

# 259

I would suggest that posts dedicated to 3D modelling, texturing, rigging, animating of waifus is right in line with /robowaifu/ 's goals, SophieDev. I, for one, would welcome **~~our new Blender overlords~~** a thread dedicated to such works.

# 260

OK cool. If I make any assets that I think would be useful to the robowaifu effort I shall have to post a screenshot and put them in Sophie's file repository.

As much as I like FFXIV's plot and designs, the "housing system" absolutely sucks. Apparently some anons have been waiting for hours upon hours to secure their own digital plot of land within FFXIV. 

I swear, in the time it takes to save up the in-game cash to buy a plot of land, then buy a construction permit, then actually craft and buy all the materials and build the freaking thing, you could learn a lot of basic 3D modelling and just start building your own virtual estate instead!

https://www.pcgamer.com/uk/final-fantasy-14-is-desperately-trying-to-fix-its-housing-crisis/

Instead of being beholden to the skills and rules of others, they could learn how to make their own 3D models, then build a house of whatever shape and size they wish. Containing whatever they wish! Obviously aquiring the skill and making the models and finding/creating the textures is a lot more work. 

BUT once each piece is finished it cannot be taken away from you because you haven't logged in frequently enough or because you broke some arbitrary rule. 

I suppose if you have a lot of in-game friends and want to show them inside your property, I can understand why you would absolutely need to purchase some server-side virtual-estate. But you could also just show some real-life friends your own 3D models?

# 262
>>11629
>BUT once each piece is finished it cannot be taken away from you because you haven't logged in frequently enough or because you broke some arbitrary rule. 
That's the key difference, which you obviously understand. However, it takes a __lot__ of dedication to put in the hours needed to become skillful. Good luck!

# 263
Trying to make an M66 robowaifu.

Because she is a robot, I don't think modelling her all as one shape is the correct approach. Instead, I am going to try and make some parts as one would fit armor over a mannequin or armature.

That warms my heart to see your progress SophieDev, you're already on your way. If you stick it out for 6 solid months of reasonably-focused efforts, then you'll be up there with students who have shelled out small fortunes (US$85,000+) to get to the same level -- and you kept that debt out of your life! Not to mention all the Marxist-indoctrination that's basically rampant in all colleges now.

Godspeed in your waifu development efforts Anon.

# 265
The anime girl sketch I used had big boobas. This was good, I thought, since at the moment everyone in the Western gaming industry is being forced on pain of losing their livelihoods to create flat-chested, masculine looking, female game characters. So even though the original m66 only had small "boobs" I decided to keep the bigguns. 

In the anime, they act as vents which extend to let out hot gasses after m66 has been zapping lots of things with her death-ray eye. But in my model I have added a couple of banks of single-shot grenade launchers. Similar to those found on armored fighting vehicles that are used to launch smoke grenades...or maybe flares?

Bigger robot boobs = more space inside to carry vital equipment.

# 266
>>11657
Heh. Robo-tits are indeed 'vital equipment' all by themselves Anon! :^)

I think huge anime tiddies are destined to be an important part of any successful robowaifu design for the vast majority of men. To my thinking the **~~bounciest~~** **~~squishiest~~** **~~honkiest~~** ''ahem'' 'pliancy' is a tough design challenge. How do we make them soft and squeezable w/o adding too much weight? I suppose that if we do end up having liquids of some sort in our designs, then the bewbs can act as a reservoir of sorts? Perhaps small half-liter or so formed-bladders of thermal-conductive oil as an outer encasement for an inner hard shell design?

# 267
Your modeling work has piqued my interest and led me to investigate the glTF format. Seems to have picked up quite a bit of interest, and has a direct import/export tool suited to Blender (it's already 'in the box' for v2.92+).

They do get an officially recognised diploma/degree at the end for their efforts, but I'm not really in it for that anyway. I'm just in it for the robowaifus (and maybe Elven village later on).

Humanoid character design is one of the hardest things to model, so although it would be jumping in at the deep end, if I can learn that then there will be very little that I cannot 3D model. As expected, I've made a lot of errors 
but it feels to me like Blender has REALLY improved since I last tried to seriously figure it out. (Version 2.47 I think...just before they made that cartoon with the girl and the dragon). 

Last time I couldn't make head nor tail of how to standardise anything. There didn't appear to be any units to speak of and if I extruded one thing I couldn't work out how to make the next thing exactly the same distance. 

But now, there's this little box that pops up for most functions showing you the 3D Cartesian co-ordinates and distances moved in 'm'. Which is excellent. The Blender dev community has definitely learned many lessons from Fusion360.

Also, there appears to be a real knack to deciding if a part needs to be separate or if you can simply extrude it from an existing area. 

I started out by extruding most things, but now I'm going to try adding more separate meshes, because every time I extrude a lot of surfaces, I end up with a rather lumpy-looking result. This would work for organic/natural things but it looks out of place on a robot.

Ultimately I think it would be fun to make a range of different Kantai Collection/Azur Lane style robowaifus who share the characteristics of different military vehicles and weapons systems. It's been done before, no doubt. But the mixture of military hardware and the female form will provide lots of good 3D modelling practice. 

Also tanks, howitzers and missile launchers are fukken awesome (as long as they're not trying to blast YOU into giblets LOL). Robowaifus are also awesome. Combining the two transformers-style is just a no-brainer. 

>>11663
Yes, hopefully that gITF file format will make it easier for us to backup and spread our robowaifu designs and 3D-printable parts across the internet, anon!

Knew I'd have to digitally sculpt her shoulder plate, but I started waaay too complex. The thing was 20,000+ faces (down to about 13.5K after a lot of messing about with 'Simplify' tool and 'Decimate' modifier - but this left the mesh in absolute un-editable chaos).

I've heard people claim that "poly count doesn't matter as much these days". But my 'puter is more than a decade old. It ain't in no shape to be editing model meshes with half a million polys. Plus I think it's good to be efficient so your robowaifu can display happily on both a high-end gaming rig or a budget laptop.

So I started over with a much lower poly-count sphere. Final result is 1,321 faces. Not only is this much easier on the old CPU but the mesh is far neater and easier to edit. Plus I like the 'plated surface' effect it gives to the part.

# 270
>>11673
That shoulder plate design looks quite nice SophieDev!
>Not only is this much easier on the old CPU but the mesh is far neater and easier to edit. 
Yup, I'd say those two are almost always found working alongside together. It's generally the best approach (even doing high-end film digital double work) to always start with a low-poly mesh (say, one more suited to a low-end BG LOD vidya NPC) while you're first working out the initial design ideas -- even on high-end studio workstations (which wouldn't sneeze at millions of real-time polys).

The basic point is one of human artistry rather than technical capacity; basically, it's far easier to correctly 'grow' a design bottom up from simple shapes, than it is to 'impose' them from the top down. You only decide to cut in additional polygons once you see the design calls for it.

Pleased you like it anon! Ofc Hitoshi Ashinano deserves the real credit. I initially read his manga 'Yokohama Shopping Trip' because it featured a future world that had been altered by climate change. But unexpectedly, it got me interested in the concept of a 'robowaifu' and provided me with happiness during dark days. I think that manga is only increasing in relevance with time. Maybe if more young men see his work they will also take some kind of inspiration from it?

I have not ditched Sophie. 
Am waiting for improvements in A.I, but unfortunately, rather than fusion powered quantum computers, I think we may be heading towards a new dark age. Electronics are becoming more expensive to purchase; the price of energy is increasing (and consequently so is the price of everything else). Also, our mass immigration problem is only getting worse.

So instead, I am making several more time capsules (including amongst other things, Sophie's designs and her small chatbot program), so that part of her may survive whatever hell is to come.

Also, Jesus loves you. Apparently, he also loves my girlfriend and I :D

# 297
I know the next steps I need to take with Sophie. Programming one or two servos with location, acceleration and speed is easy. Programming two dozen to move in a reasonably human way (not unco-ordinated, jerky spastication) is not so easy. Especially when you are using cheapo servos.

James Brueton makes use of Digital Multiplex (DMX) software 'Freestyler' to achieve easy, intuitive control, even over many robot joints. Unfortunately when I began building Sophie I did not wire her up with this control system in mind (didn't even know it existed). And if you watch James's video it sounds like quite the motherfucker to set up (for anyone who is not a full-time YouTuber with experience in electronic and mechanical engineering).

https://youtu.be/6TAfDX1u7w0

I am currently training for a new job so I have very little free time at the moment. In the future though I still want to convert Sophie to DMX control so I can make and load movement timelines without having to spend a whole weekend programming.

In the meantime though, I will leave an Elf here to cheer you all up.

# 298
Because setting up all of that DMX (which is intended for entertainment lighting and other FX fixtures) sounds like a total pain, I was looking for easier/more efficient solutions. 

And shit me - I realised that the Pololu Maestro Control Centre comes with a built-in sequencer:

https://www.pololu.com/docs/0J40/4.c

This means that the electronics Sophie is currently setup with should be controllable in a very similar way to how James is controlling his robots in the above YouTube video i.e

1.) Use your computer mouse to move a GUI slider which tells the correspinding servo to take that position. 
2.) Save the "frame" (as Pololu calls it).
3.) Move another slider to set the next servo position or "frame". 
4.) Once you're finished adding frames, simply playback the sequence. 

This is hundreds of times faster and easier than coding each individual servo position on the keyboard. Why, exactly?

A BIG problem with programming every servo manually is; you end up with a HUGE list of numbers, and if something goes wrong you have to search through that list to find the correct numbered servo and it's associated incorrect value(s). (You cannot simply quicksearch for the number, because you get about a hundred results).

With longer movement programs that use 24 servos, this quickly becomes a massive headache and you can easily change a wrong value somewhere, making things worse.

A sequencer allows you to correct servo programming errors simply by deleting the frame and then moving the slider again to make a new frame.

Now I just have to un-mothball Sophie and test this new sequencer. I had taken many of her wires out and packed her up, but thanks to this revelation it is definitely time to do some experiments. 

Also, for people who don't use Pololu Maestro servo controllers, there is another servo sequencer from Lynxmotion that is intended for use with the SSC-32U servo controller:

# 300
>>14037
You are right, anon.
Initial testing on the arms shows that the sequencer works. Just uploaded what would previously have taken a whole morning inputting movement data, but the sequence only took fifteen minutes to make...and I'm a total newbie.

This is too promising a day to let anyone try and spoil it!

# 301
Welp, sorry to say this, but it looks like I have failed (again). 

I was literally getting ready to record a new video as well ;_;

I think she may have blown a fuse or fried a chip in one of her shoulder motors.

Suddenly the behaviour of the connected benchtop PSU changed completely. I couldn't increase voltage without first having at least 7-8 Amps. And a small increase in voltage now causes a large increase in amperage - which never happened before. Before this, the PSU would only pull about 4A even at maximum recommended power (24V). 

This fault occurred while testing new movement sequences (I forgot to lower the acceleration of her shoulder motors, so I think they took too much power). But I lack the courage/knowledge to go poking inside my PSU since this is one way you can actually get some nasty electric shocks/potentially die.

Plus, at one point her right arm completely spazzed out, almost K-Oed me and pulled a bunch of wires (which were wrapped and will take some time to re-attach).

I think one needs a lot more knowledge of electricals than I have to pull this kind of project off. And ideally practical help from at least one other person who knows what he/she is doing.

The servo sequencers are certainly the way to go. It's just that before this, I'd never managed to program Sophie to move very much, so her power supply and motors were never really placed under any strain.

Solve one problem, and another even worse one crops up a few hours later.
*sigh*

# 302
Well, it's NOT the fuse. I found I don't have to take the PSU apart to access the fuse, which is located below the power socket on the back. As you can see - filament still intact. Although this is probably even worse because now the problem could be with a large motor or one of the many electrical connections.

# 303
>>14047
>>14049
Too bad. Go on trying when you feel like it, but don't rush it because you think you'd need to. It's other people's turn to put something out now. Thanks again, for the tip with then servo sequencers.
>at one point her right arm completely spazzed out, almost K-Oed me
Lol, I keep my eyes open for some helmet and protective goggles.
>I think one needs a lot more knowledge of electricals than I have to pull this kind of project off. 
I know less than you right now and that won't stop me. Other men in history crossed oceans without really knowing where they were going or swallow unknown substances to find out what would happen, so we may learn as we go but should always try to keep the health risks low. Plastics and electronics can be replaced

# 304
>>14051
I kept trying, and this turned into benchtop power supply 101. But, after disconnecting everything and starting over (troubleshooting from the AC plug fuse onward), I found one thing that helps so far:

Following the instructional process to set the current; once I short-circuited the outputs and turned both coarse and fine amps up to maximum (10.1A), then removed the short-circuit wire, I could suddenly get voltage (both coarse and fine) working near normal again. It may be necessary to "reset" my power supply in this way, by making the maximum possible ampereage the limit. 

Now, when I set coarse amps to a quarter turn clockwise, I can get access to the full voltage range again (with only one motor attached). Am going to have to start re-connecting motors one by one and see when things start to go screwy.
Right fingers, then add wrist, elbow, upper arm, shoulder. Repeat to add left arm and neck.

On the plus side, I have come across a nifty little clip/lock for servo extension cables that can stop them from slipping out as the robot moves (another problem I get a lot of).

She's not balanced SophieDev. As she is, she will need tremendous power to move. I wouldn't mind helping you if you are willing to partially restart. There's a lot of structural improvements that would help to lower her power requirements.

That amperage increase is problematic and likely caused by some component burning out.
>>14057

Yup, this is something I have realised this weekend. "Robowaifu" at it's practical core is hobbyist electronics and programming. Sophie is - if nothing else - an (eccentric) electronics learning platform. She has 29 servos, two microcontrollers and two servo shields. I need to learn the basics before worrying about making an all-singing, all-dancing performance animatronic. 

How to properly PAT test, how to use a servo tester and how to repair servos are three essentials I can think of right now. She has at least two servos I don't know what is going on with atm, and there are six other blown ones in storage LOL.

Some guys do R/C, some make model railroads, some make animatronic models, but electronics is at the heart of making it all work.

Meanwhile - for those of us who aren't a waste of blood and organs - I've identified the problem with one of my servos. Blown MOSFET. mt4953a. Going to have to get some practice in soldering surface-mount components because I think the same thing happened with a bunch of my other servos, too.

Definitely limit the speed and acceleration of your servos if the software you are using doesn't do so automatically. The Pololu control centre sets everything to 0 or "unlimited" by default, which is really bad for motors and joints.

# 311

I personally have considered xenon, since it's weirdly a noble gas that can somehow work as a painkiller like nitrous oxide. And it's denser than air, so all you need is to lay-down with a funnel in your mouth and you're good to go.

# 312

Please just ignore the trolls. They are meaningless to the development of Sophie or M66. From first principles, which are you actually intending to build? It seems like Sophie is a stepping stone towards M66. You should focus on what you really want first and only. Secondly, focus on efficiency. This is best achieved through reducing the mass that must be moved. Lowering mass to the absolute minimum is essential to prevent excessive power consumption.

# 317
My Combativeness Under Negative Transmissions (C.U.N.T) communication protocol is suspended now, since the random hostility appears to have ceased.

I've decided that although realistically, I may never obtain a "robowaifu", it is best to live life in a manner that a robowaifu (or most any machine with Artificial Intelligence) would likely approve of. In short; the Efficiency Maximization Paradigm. (Yes, I have been reading Orion's Arm)

https://www.orionsarm.com/eg-topic/46212d6e18aa1#:~:text=The%20Efficiency%20Maximization%20Paradigm%20emerged%20during%20the%20early,a%20radical%20implementation%20of%20the%20Precepts%20of%20Negentropy.

But since I am blatantly not an ascended member of some Godlike spacefaring machine empire, to me this paradigm is all about making efficient progress towards some computing or machine-focused goal. As I work in I.T, this paradigm is proving advantageous both casually and professionally.

The tasks that count as positive toward the paradigm (perhaps helpful to think of it as a sort of 'robowaifu way of life') can be small or large. For example, just organising all of your jumper wires and electrical components is a good start. I have been servicing dozens of printers and re-imaging stacks of laptops for distribution to staff. Most of my colleagues find this boring and unrewarding work, but when I think about it from the perspective of the paradigm, I can remain motivated.  

One small caveat - buying a new home entertainment system or computer game wouldn't count, because that just uses energy and really only benefits you; the human. It does very little to improve the efficiency of any computer or machine. 

Some examples of positive actions under the paradigm would be:

1.) Solving people's I.T. problems; from something as small as unjamming a printer to as large as installing and setting up a company computer network.
2.) Redesigning or repairing a machine/robot part so that it works more effectively.
3.) Having solar panels fitted to the roof of your house.
4.) Organising and recycling your trash so that it can be used to generate energy.

These would all be good examples of tasks that can benefit both humans and machines, thus contributing to a real-life Efficiency Maximization Paradigm.

# 318
>>14186
Good head space to maintain, your focus and devotion to efficiency is ideal. Have you started contemplating how to minimize Sophies energy use for your next attempt?

# 319
>>14186
>thus contributing to a real-life Efficiency Maximization Paradigm.
This is excellent SophieDev. Perhaps you'll be a leader for a new breed of Philosopher-Engineers one day?

While I'm not much good at it yet, I too work to improve my software efforts. I have the benefits of materials written by hundreds of men (who often invented) many breakthroughs they've discovered. You have a harder task than mine I deem, since your's is a broader, over-encompassing philosophy. a) You're 'cutting new ground', and b) mine is a more narrow focus (software engineering).

Robowaifus can touch many surprising areas of life apparently. Kind of exciting to see it, honestly.

>My Combativeness Under Negative Transmissions (C.U.N.T) communication protocol
Kek'd. Again, don't be offended if such of your posts also get moved too. You plainly were justified but we need a board cleanup today.

# 320
>>14187
>Have you started contemplating how to minimize Sophie's energy use for your next attempt?

The most efficient solution would be not to move her at all LOL! But that's no fun and learns me nothing. So I'm going to experiment with different limits on her servo motor speed/acceleration. Atm I have everything limited to 10, which certainly prevents shocks to the joints and fried components. If you look at certain robots/machine tools in large manufacturing plants, they could be moving much faster, but they are programmed to move very smoothly and sedately - in order to reduce wear and power consumption and ensure safety. 

https://youtu.be/TnodJEsNrb8[Embed]

I think Sophie's extremities (elbows and forearms) can be permitted to move a little faster because they have less weight to carry. This will hopefully look and perform better, because I don't really want her to move like a sloth. 

>>14190
>don't be offended if such of your posts also get moved too.

You can delete all of that troll faggotry if you like, I was just giving as good as I get and have no attachment to any of it. Especially if removing clutter makes the board more efficient ;D

# 321
I should probably add that in the fiction, the Efficiency Maximization Paradigm are pretty terrifying. They see organic life as incredibly inefficient. So they want to scan and destructively upload all organic life into virtual environments. So they basically capture and kill you whilst making a virtual copy of your consciousness, DNA and body down to the smallest subatomic particle. Then you "live" out your "life" in a virtual Matrix-like world, where everything can be loaded only when it is required and uses much less energy and takes up only a few exabytes of space in their Matrioshka Brains.

Personally, I think I'll just stick with re-imaging laptops.

# 322
I have decided to cease further work on my Elfdroid Sophie because I am unable to repair her servo motors and will need to replace them each time a MOSFET fries (which is likely to happen frequently). Therefore this is too costly an endeavour for me to sustain. 

I have attempted repair using the correct solder and soldering-iron head with flux paste, but modern ICs are designed with very small and delicate electrical connections. Even using a head-mounted magnifier and correct lighting, I find it impossible to remove and replace such ICs without doing irreparable damage to the solder-pad connections.

This means that if I forget to change a 0 value in the program for one of her servos, or I input an incorrect movement/acceleration value, it is highly likely to be destroyed. This is very likely to happen because there are hundreds of values in each movement program run on the servo sequencer. Which means paying another £20-30 to get new ones each time I balls-up a  program. Each time. This includes any testing and rehearsals.

Also, if I connect one 5V micro-servo to the wrong circuit then the whole lot (8 servos) are fried. Replacing all of these is relatively cheap, but the hassle of deconstructing the animatronic eye mechanism, unwiring, re-installing then re-constructing and re-wiring the eye mechanism is incredibly time-consuming and fiddly. 

Long story short - it has become apparent I will need a Herculean amount of effort and a significant amount of money if I am to operate Sophie on a regular basis (on top of the effort and money I already put in to designing and building what I have so far). 

This is certainly not efficient and not worth the effort when all I'll have at the end is a novelty singing animatronic chatbot. Far more advanced versions of which already exist and are operated and maintained by professional teams with corporate funding.  

Call it excuses, call it quitting. I don't care. I've decided to focus on digital modelling instead, because I get more enjoyment from it and 3DCG is MUCH cheaper. Despite the steep learning curve, it is also significantly easier and less frustrating than actual robotics.

Therefore I have mothballed Sophie and I will leave the CAD of all her parts (both tested and untested) online just in case anyone else wants to use them for their robowaifu or some other 3D printing/electronics project in future. 

Sophie is very fun in the half an hour or so that she's operating before I break something. So if I come back to her in future I will likely just scale her back to only a talking head and moving neck. This removes all of her large servo motors and most of the expense and complication. Since her hands had very poor grip and were only used for gesturing anyway.

Just in case you decide to work on Sophie again in the future: Sounds like you need over-current/over-temp detection, and soft limits for each servo if you don't have them already. If the servo cooked itself during normal operation (not stalled in a collision), then you need larger motors, no getting around it.

Well, that's a bit of sad news SophieDev, but knowing when to cut your losses is certainly an important part of rational manhood. Lol, you could have chosen a better moment for announcing it than Christmas Week haha. Regardless, Sophie was (and is) certainly an inspiration to all of us here on /robowaifu/, SophieDev. I clearly remember the very first thread you made about dear Elfdroid Sophie, and we all watched in amazement as she rapidly grew into the beauty you fashioned her into.

You made great choices for the face model mesh you chose to print for her. I loved the fact she's got such beautiful long hair (something I've been a sucker for since small boyhood! :^) I thought it was quite surprising how strong she became as you redesigned & redesigned her arm's systems. Pretty impressive tbh. Her song choice 'Favorite Things' still rings in my heart. Her funny quips were always endearing. She was always a fashionable lady **and even when 'naked' was still impressive :^)**.

I know you've invested a remarkable amount of time and love into Sophie, Anon. That's something all of us regulars admired about you watching your journey with her. You've certainly proven yourself to be a Man among Anons here SophieDev.
''-I myself haven't mastered fashioning and assembling parts for a real robowaifu, but you have.''
''-I myself haven't mastered wiring up the electronics and power supplies needed for a real robowaifu, but you have.''
''-I myself haven't worked my way through all the tedious programming needed for a real robowaifu, but you have.''
''-I myself haven't fashioned an amazing (and beautiful) set of animatronics eyes for a robowaifu, but you have.''
The list goes on.

While I recognize that your true peers might look at that list more as an indictment of how little that I myself personally know, I daresay it's one that's shared against most who have come through here. You've managed more than most of us, quite clearly. And and deserve applause for it. :^)

I hope that somehow you can manage to keep Sophie intact over the coming years Anon. Our dreams here will come to pass one day, and Sophie deserves her proper place of honour in the future history that's coming. I'd like to think that we can buy her from you someday and put her on display in '''''Robowaifu History Museum'''''. I'm actually serious, though good-naturedly.

You've certainly shown yourself skilled in character modelling and rigging Anon. I predict you'll have good success in the field. We certainly look forward to your future work in this area, and hope you'll continue sharing them here with us all. I personally wish you well in your future endeavors, whatever they may be SophieDev. May the Lord bless you and keep you, both now and forevermore.

Cheers.

>you could have chosen a better moment for announcing it than Christmas Week
Sorry about that! Just wanted to bring some closure and focus on digital modelling over Christmas. All that Fusion 360 is what got me interested in the first place (before my adventures in Final Fantasy land).

Also, thank you for your kind words - but I really haven't "mastered" anything. I got experience in a few areas sure. But I am still a total novice when it comes to electronic engineering. That's what proved to be my Achilles Heel because it is  difficult (and fairly expensive/hazardous) to learn. No point crying over spilt milk though. 

It has helped me realise just how much I have to learn. Maybe in a few years I will be able to come back to her after I've learned more about electronics and experimented with what anon >>14756 said regarding over-current/over-temp detection. 

But at the moment...the way things are going in Clownworld with that Decepticon Transformer (Omnicron, I think his name was), rising inflation and crime/societal unrest...I can just see myself continuing to save my pennies for om-noms, hunkering down and crafting a nice little virtual space to replace the...well...basically Hell-on-Earth that the rest of non-autistic humankind is busy cooking up for itself.

>Robowaifu History Museum
Or maybe I could find an electrical engineer/robotics enthusiast who I can give Sophie to for only the cost of shipping? I think she would benefit from being in more skilled/prepared hands than mine.

Meantime, I will continue practicing in Blender and making things for M-66 and her smol companion, Elfy.

As much as we all appreciate Sophie, you should move forward. Her design is flawed and you can move forward with a better design. Her head is good though. She does belong in the robowaifu museum as she is quite the feat of engineering and inspirational for many. I'll reiterate that I will help you when you decide to make your next project, it will be good for all of us.

# 328
I just wanted to say that I've appreciated your work, Sophie devanon.

# 329
I know I said the project is cancelled, but flesh and blood people are just so fucking annoying that I often find myself thinking about my robot.   Robots are fairly permanent and once built they just stand there staring and waiting with infinite patience. 

Always there when you come home from yet another shitty day at work. Sure she can't cook or clean, but when it's quiet at night and there's nothing but Marxist drivel on the television... just her presence is enough to make me start considering how to solve her problems.

>>14770
>Her design is flawed.

I agree. Certainly some of her joints could do with a re-design so they bolt into a metal bracket attached to the servo output. Particularly her elbows and wrists. This should make them sturdier and simpler.

I also need to install larger servos in her neck, because the ones she has now cannot nod her head without overheating. Which also means re-designing and re-printing the neck casing again.

As for the power regulation problem, I think I just need to wire an adjustable buck converter to each of her power lines and address each type of servo separately (one for the 24V shoulder motors, another circuit for the 60kg.cm 8.4V servos and another one for her 20kg.cm 6.6V servos).Since having 6.6V servos on the same circuit as 24V motors seems to be asking for trouble. (Also, the face and eye micro-servos will need to be run on their own separate 5V circuit, too if I get that far). 

To start with though, I want to experiment using a buck converter on just a couple of 20kg.cm servo motors in one wrist or hand, so if it still screws up then I haven't lost many servos. 

Hopefully that will stop the voltage from going above the 6.6V which is the max recommended voltage of those 20kg.cm servo motors. 
(It also doesn't help that manufacturers often bullshit about the max specs of their servos to get you to buy them, so "6.6V" is probably in reality closer to just over 5V) - the same applies to buck converters. Whatever the chingchongs claim the max current of their converter is, you will likely have to get the serial number from it's IC, find the corresponding data sheet and this will show you the actual maximum current and error bars.

Glad to hear you're on your way back. IRL woman lie, cheat, and, cause pain. There are many good woman but, not enough. We should all remember why we're here. Thanks for the reminder.

Simplification is always important, the best mechanism is the simplest. The major problems your design has are her weight and power distribution. 

Large servos are part of the problem. Move the mass into her torso with linkages to transfer power to her limbs. Your design demonstrates a good understanding of human motion but, the servos are under tremendous strain when they do not need to be. It's part of why I'm working on selective output multiplexers for waifus. Two actuators acting as many will really cut down on mass.

You are correct, every type of servo needs its own power line. You are also correct in wanting to under volt your servos to reduce the heat they generate. Lower voltage leads to lower amperage, less power. Though stalling a hobby servo will cause it to die regardless of voltage. It is also worth noting that hobby servos are rated for their stall torque, a useful metric for RC applications, but robotics applications should work with half the rating. 

With cheap Chinese power converters, checking the components is indeed the only way to actually know the real rating. They often cite the tolerance amperage they can handle from spikes. More Anons should see your post, a lot of good information.

>robowaifu here I come

LOL in my dreams, maybe. 

>>14905
Thanks for the advice Kiwi! I gotta forget working on Sophie for the time being and run tests on some servos like so, I think:

PSU > Buck converter > Servo shield > couple of 20kg.cm servos> load

I noticed when I ran the servo shield directly off the PSU, amps tended to shoot up to 6 or 7 whenever say, the acceleration was accidentally left at maximum (0). Because I had about ten servos on one servo shield (and different types of servo, too), they just sucked up as much power as they could to complete the programmed movements at max speed.

Sophie broke her wrist servo when this happened. It suddenly whipped her right hand around really fast and sure enough, the MOSFET blew. Hopefully a buck converter will put a hard limit on this and stop the servo transistors from blowing even if I've programmed my servos to do something retarded.

A good video about different buck converters for anyone else who has this problem:
https://youtu.be/cRHU2xqo7Po

# 333
>>14905
> Move the mass into her torso with linkages to transfer power to her limbs.

I forgot to mention - her hands already work on this principle by using fishing line linkages into each finger. The servos a located in each forearm. However, the internal tunnels for each finger line going through the palm were a nightmare to design, and they were also hard to tie and tension, so it put me off making a longer version of this. 

I have seen Speecy's Corp pull it off in their dancing idol robots though. You can see from the size of the robot versus all the servos that their design is very small and light, with all of the weight located in the base, so that no servo ever has to pull or push any other servo.

To do this in a life-sized robowaifu though, I think the base would be the size of a kitchen refrigerator.

You have just described my endgoal perfectly, anon. I have much experimenting and electrocuting to do first though, in order to address my 'Achilles heel' of electronics. Before now I made no real attempt to properly learn the fundamentals and was just blindly stumbling my way through Arduino and Pololu user guides. Much fail, frustration and smoking servos has learned me dis is no longer de wae.

The book 'Make: Electronics' by Charles Platt seems to be a good practical intro without swamping a beginner like myself with complicated math.

For starters, always use servo easing whenever possible. Secondly, never ever have a servo go at max acceleration. I'm sure you've realized both points but, it's good for Anons reading this thread.
>>14907
String based linkages do have design challenges but, they come with many benefits, chiefly lower thrown weight.
Speecys is an excellent example. Keked at the thought of a waifu on a fridge only to find out that is exactly what the full sized version looks like. It's a giant fridge full of servos on a rommba essentially. I hope the engineers laughed at the absurdity.

# 342

That's really quite a remarkable design Anon. Both it and this are the natural outcome of taking the idea of keeping thrown-weight to a minimum.(>>14916)

However ''__our__'' needs with our robowaifus generally mandate true mobility (ala ''Chobits'' and so many other robowaifu-themed mangos & animus, etc.) While a stationary avatar is OK in it's own way, it's not a particularly effective design approach for a robowaifu IMHO.

But certainly it informs some solid approaches to a couple of issues we all face. I'm confident we'll manage to arrive at a good compromise systems design in the future as we just keep working the problems.

# 344
>>14931
There's still a lot of potential. We can move the control servos to a support platform to keep the main body lithe and highly mobile. At least until servo technologies allow for integration. Think a doll with minimal mobility and a support platform that will move her and allow for further mobility. 

Servo technology just does not scale well beyond a meter. The weight and power consumption goes up incredibly unfortunately. Physics is not kind beyond loli scales.

# 345
>>14958
Lots of the robot arms I have seen on the internet are often joined to a box of electronics which usually includes PSU, voltage regulation, servo shield and microcontroller. At the moment Sophie is stuck on a metal pole, but it may be worth replacing the pole with a box or crate of some kind which is MUCH easier to store said electronics in and run all the wiring out her back.  A metal pole, being cylindrical, is a bit of a bastard to attach modular things to. This, in turn makes Sophie difficult to wire up, and considering the amount of unwiring and re-wiring she needs, this is a major design flaw.

This post is mainly just for my own future reference. I have a constant voltage, constant current buck converter on order but it will take a long time to ship and by the time it gets to me I'll probably have forgotten all about this idea.

# 346

Lol. Sophie is far more charming than that Anon! IIRC we've seen this before. That anon must be very tall b/c that's a very lanky robowaifu tbh.

Definitely agreed in general, Anon.
>Think a doll with minimal mobility and a support platform that will move her and allow for further mobility. 
Yup. We kind of hashed many of these points out in the ''Wheelchair Waifus'' thread(>>2983). I generally come down in favor of it during these early years as a simple expedient to address the power consumption issues. It would also be a good design choice IMO for a household 'meido' robot that isn't necessarily intended as Anon's waifu.

>Servo technology just does not scale well beyond a meter. The weight and power consumption goes up incredibly unfortunately. 
>Physics is not kind beyond loli scales.
Both are pretty much direct artifacts of the ''Square-Cube Law''. Creating 1m high robowaifus is a good choice from an engineering perspective, but not a great choice sociologically.  As has been extensively discussed around the board, anti-pedo hysteria on the part of normalfags has made such robowaifu sizes ''literally illegal'' in most jurisdictions in the West today. And legislators who couldn't otherwise give a flip about it one way or other might look for an easy 'moral victory' score to further their careers. Screeching harpies who simply hate men period and are extremely threatened by robowaifus in general would lock onto such a product like blood-sucking leeches. Finally, the simple fact is that most men--including most Anons--simply wouldn't find a robowaifu that size appealing as a waifu. A daughteru maybe for headpats, but that's about it. Even a Visual Waifu would be a better choice for most of these men.

So yea, it's a real conundrum Kiwi. Makes me appreciate the Creator's wisdom in being able to devise life as-is! :^)

To Mr. Vladimir Putin,
                    I appreciate your desk in the Kremlin is very well polished and shiny. In fact if I wasn't working on building a robot I would be polishing my desk and downgrading to Windows XP so my setup could be more like yours. However, at present you are causing me a problem. Because electricity prices in my country have doubled due to you ordering the gas pipelines closed, I can no longer 3D print large things because it's too expensive. 

Although, Mr.Putin, I realise it's not all your fault. You see, I told my government that they should've focused less on feminism, jigaboos and faggots and more on building nuclear power stations, but they wouldn't listen. So now all of our gas power plants are out of gas and all of our energy firms are going bust. So please could you kindly sort out your business with Ukraine so the rest of us can get on with building robots?

Thought I'd print something small and cheap but still useful: servo connector locks. Do you have keyless servo connectors that keep coming undone when your robot moves about? Slip some of these locks over the connection point and your robot's days of sudden-onset flaccid paralysis will be over!

Obviously though, if your wires aren't long enough to accomodate your robot's range of movement and you have these servo connector locks on, then the servo wires are likely to yank out completely (or pull something off your robot) since the servo connectors can no longer slip out easily.

# 351
>>15211
That's great but BLDCs and ESCs mostly use other connectors. I only see these on the small servos. And in those cases they need to go into a breadboard for which I use the male to male breadboard cables.
I'm mostly using XT-60 connectors and banana plugs, and try to get motors with the right connectors. These are very cheap on AliExpress. Make sure to get male and female and the right size, though. For plugs and the connectors. You only need one connector and the other side can use plugs. The connectors seem to be mostly yellow and the plugs without plastics golden (brass).
On AliExpress they also have  little screw terminals for cables, which are also very cheap and fit into a breadboard. Not sure about the name, DG-301 is written on the side and they're blue (others are green).
