It's hard to keep track of all the developments that are happening in artificial intelligence and related areas. Perhaps we could share our favourite research papers to get a better feel for all the progress happening and what we need to do next to make robowaifus a reality.

I'm mostly focused on general intelligence but this thread can be for  anything that has captured and held your attention for long periods of time, whether in speech synthesis, creativity, robotics, materials, or anything else.

Most may be already familiar with AlphaZero, the general reinforcement learning algorithm that mastered Chess, Shogi, and Go through self-play. It's a significant contribution everyone learning about AI needs to understand. It uses ResNets for a policy network and a Monte Carlo tree search to explore most likely possibilities and collapse the search tree into an improved probability distribution of expected outcomes for each possible move.

The papers are rather being posted in the relevant threads, but we could use this thread to share some sources for longer articles and papers to download.

arXiv is a free distribution service and an open-access archive for 1,811,158 scholarly articles in the fields of physics, mathematics, computer science, quantitative biology, quantitative finance, statistics, electrical engineering and systems science, and economics. Materials on this site are not peer-reviewed by arXiv: https://arxiv.org/
 
"The Machine Intelligence Research Institute, formerly the Singularity Institute for Artificial Intelligence, is a non-profit research institute focused since 2005 on identifying and managing potential existential risks from artificial general intelligence. MIRI's work has focused on a friendly AI approach to system design and on predicting the rate of technology development."

This posting >>7855 is based on an article from there. Looking into their research might be useful when our AI is getting more complex, not just be AIML chatbots. They have research, papers, and analyses on their website.

Good idea, thanks Anon.
