'''Servos, Actuators, Structural, Mechatronics, etc.'''

You can't build a robot without robot parts tbh. Please post good resources for obtaining or constructing them.

Small pneumatic or hydraulic actuators are becoming the biggest issue I can find. The only small ones I seem to find have very limited pressure.

Do you think something like a screw-drive & rack-drive linear actuator could serve in place of a hydraulic one Anon? There are several linear actuators in different sizes readily available. They are electrically-driven ofc. Some can produce quite a bit of force.

Apologies if this video has already been posted, but I found it fascinating and liberating to get a glimpse of how many experts and just how much testing it takes to get a humanoid robot working properly. 

Boston Dynamics employs around 300 people. In this video just over a dozen are shown. That should give an idea of just how much work goes into this.

Neat, thanks SophieDev. I feel reasonably confident saying I don't believe this video has been posted here before. Very interesting.

I think it's absolutely amazing that we here are going to make __better__ humanoid robots, on a shoe-string budget, from a small group of robowaifu-pioneering Anons. Ours will eventually be with men all over the world, while theirs will stay limited to govt. institutions only. ''Their multi-billion dollar conglomerate loaded with highly-paid, highly-educated engineers and designers (and absolutely '''drenched''' in the Globohomo Big Tech/Gov) vs. our merry little band of adventurers.''

Real life ''Robin Hood''-tier stuff -- it will be glorious! :^)

Really cool cheap yet powerful stepper servo desigh.

That does looks cool Anon. I'll download the video and have a look at it. Are there any other links to go along with it do you know (hackaday, instructables, etc)?

--write-description option in youtube-dl will write the text coming with the video. Otherwise look at the page or in the app. I aw the video before, it's fascinating, but it might not be so great for a compliant humanoid robot, because these sun gears with high reduction ratio are not backdriveable. Otherwise it would fit better in the thread for actuators. This thread here seem to only exist for other robots than waifus.

Thanks, but this should be moved to >>374
