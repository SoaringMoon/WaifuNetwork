Decided it may be best to place my 3D digital modelling efforts in a separate thread to my work on 'Elfdroid Sophie'. I think this thread will still belong under "Personal Projects".
At the moment the 3D modelling begins over on her thread:
>>11644
>>11657

I'm using some source material from Masamune Shirow's 1987 OVA "Black Magic - M66" (which itself was based off his 1983 manga).

However, as a child of the late eighties/early nineties, I loved 'Transformers', and I was also a big fan of the 'Heavy Gear' series (similar to MechWarrior), and Armored Core.

So I often get the urge to create battle-ready robowaifus, but I can only create them virtually. Because obviously I cannot get hold of machine-guns, explosives, tank cannons, and rocket launchers IRL. Good thing, too, since if I were given access to live ammunition I would almost certainly blow myself into a flying streamer of giblets.

But I digress. This thread may also be a good place for any equally deranged anons who wish to post images of military-grade robowaifus, either found online or their own creations?

# 2
LOL wtf am I doing? I can't draw feet in 2D, never mind model them in 3D! Oh well. To prove that this thread was more than just an excuse to post M66 pictures.

# 3
>>11786
Feet are surprisingly difficult. It took me hours to do one at first, and I had already had the benefit of doing the hand first (they are similar in a few ways b/c digits). Those aren't too bad Anon, but I'd go for even lower resolution until you've blocked out the entire form to get the proportions/pose just right (think lego version of M66).

Then spend time working on the 'simpler' forms like the arms & legs. Then cut in torso details (but leave out the bewbs!). Then shape up the neck and shoulders, then the back.

At that point you can go to work on the hands and ''then'' the feet (they are tricky!). Go back up and do the bewbs, butt, and other lady bits. 

Finally you have enough familiarity with the model to begin working on the piece de resistance: '''the face'''.

Even during this forming pass though, ''don't cut in too many details!'' Still too early. Let the model site for a couple days at this stage if you have that luxury, and study other things.

Then, with 'fresh eyes' you make the third pass to tune it up into your final game mesh. (Should stay at roughly 30K - 45K polys depending on accessories, etc.)

Later once you've lived with the model for a while you can lock it into a background mode, and use it as true 3D-ref for sculpting (if you have enough h/w) a real ''hero'' mesh from her.

Good luck Anon, happy vert-wrangling! :^)

# 4
>>11792
>Let the model ''sit'' *

# 5
>>11792
I might have added:
> (Should stay at roughly 30K - 45K polys depending on accessories, etc., ''lower is better''.) *

# 6
>>11792
When I do feet, I tend to just do them in two parts. The big toe, and then the remaining four.

# 7
>>11798
Sensible thinking. I model the big & next toe separately, then just dupe the 'fore' toe 3 times, position & tweak accordingly. I guess technically they are all similar biologically-speaking, but as you suggest, they seem easier to model separately.

Similarly, I tend to rig the big and other toes separately, same as with the thumb and fingers.

# 8
>>11792
Sounds like you are a pretty experienced 3d modeller anon! I was lost as to which order to do things, so I'll follow your advice, thank you.

I have a silly idea about M66 becoming a special character in Cyberpunk 2077. Unlike the NCPD or MaxTac, M-66 only spawns in response to cheats being used by the player.
 
Once a cheat is used within the developer console, she spawns somewhere randomly on the map and starts steadily but constantly walking towards the character. If she ever gets within 100m of the cheater she will suddenly break into a sprint and start indiscriminately blasting in the players general direction with her laser-eye (ignoring NPC casualties). 

Upon reaching the player she rapidly tears you to pieces. M66 cannot be harmed by any in-game weapons or physics and her claws ignore all armor (even the tank). Once spawned, she will just keep coming until the cheater is dead.

This would probably require some horribly complex pathfinding program (unless she just walks straight through walls and buildings LOL). Considering how glitchy the game already is, it'll never happen. But I know the devs of Alien: Isolation pulled off something similar (although that wasn't a massive open-world map).

# 9
>>11835
You're very welcome. If you keep at this for 6 month's steady going, trust me you won't need any advice from me! :^) You'll have developed your own personal approach.

Still, my recommendation is directly based on hundreds of hours of character modeling work done in both school and professional settings. Just as with science & engineering, there's a guiding principle to doing this kind of technical art:
'''Do the simple things first, and the harder things will be easier'''. My recommended modeling progression for you is based directly on this notion. I think you'll find it well-suited to the beginner.

As for your gaming idea, as you point out there's little chance of it happening with 2077. But you'd probably like to play around with the animation of your model once it's fully rigged anyway, so keep your goals for it in mind Anon. Might be doable w/o too much effort in the end.

Meanwhile, keep metric shitloads of references for your characters around as a beginner. Trust me on this one! :^)

# 10
>>11840
Yeah, I gotta take things one step at a time and keep it simple. Being chased about and zapped by a psychotic robowaifu inside something like Unity Engine is a ways off yet. But I've always wanted a robowaifu who I can play LaserQuest with!

# 11
>>11868
>But I've always wanted a robowaifu who I can play LaserQuest with!
Me too, Anon. Me too. One of my dreams is having a good one to go rock-climbJust keep perfecting your skills, and you may find it's easier than you thought to get things working in an engine once you're finished with lovingly fashioning her.

# 12
Got this far (I admit I stole her head from a character I made in Honey Select), but then sculpt mode suddenly stopped working. 

It seems that I can sculpt on the pink parts but not on the dark grey. 

Looking on StackExchange and Blender forums, lots of people seem to have problems with sculpt mode breaking, so atm I'm just going to carry on without it until I have a Eureka moment.

Unless, of course someone here knows what has happened?

# 13
>>11870
Sorry, I've personally only ever used ZBrush (and Mudbox a little bit) for sculpting Anon. I assume you'd tried all the obvious things (restarting, etc). One thing I can tell you in general is that because of the nature of what the ''proxy-mesh'' process is doing during sculpting, that it's a quite GPU-intensive operation. If you have diagnostics tools for your card I'd have a look at them as you attempt sculpting. If you have older hardware, it's quite possible that Blender's sculpting mode simply can't be supported properly. ZBrush is certainly like that.

# 14
>>11870
BTW, if you'd like to push the file somewhere I'll try opening it on my box and seeing if I get the same results you do.

# 15
>>11870

# 16
>>11870
Hmm, while I read it, somehow it didn't quite sink in. Since you can already sculpt on the pink, I'd compare the modifiers list for that geometry and the geometry of the gray. Perhaps you need to apply a sculpt modifier to that geometry Anon?

Figured it out! I somehow masked the entire torso. Alt+M removes the mask so I can sculpt that surface again (there is also a way of removing all mask data, which I shall do):

https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.80/sculpt_paint/sculpting/hide_mask.html#clearing-mask-data

No idea how that happened. Don't remember even touching the mask brush. Must've pressed an incorrect key combo at some point! 

Funny thing is, I'm even familiar with the mask function from using ZBrush in the past, but I still didn't twig on.

Oh well, thank you for your help
>>11871
>>11874

And 
>>11876
>>11877 
Thank you for compiling those links anon! I have already followed along with about four tutorials that were linked here, so those will definitely help me in my Blender-hermit ways.

Once she is completed, I plan to put a copy of her mesh into the same file repositories where all of Elfdroid Sophie's parts and designs are located.

I hope to then animate her and maybe even make some kind of 'Robowaifu Laser Tag' vidya game. If all goes well, I can eventually progress from laser beams through to a range of considerably more powerful weapons.

# 20
>>11895
Excellent! Glad to know it was just that simple Anon. It pleases me to see you're tapping into the official Blender docs they are really quite good. That's directly attributable to Ton's diligent character, and his willingness to quickly get on top of technical debt (having good docs is important for any project, but much moreso for huge ones like Blender). He spent many thousands of dollars of the foundation's money getting them in order. BTW, I notice you're using v2.80 docs. You should match the docs to the version you're actually on (I'm on v2.93 for example), as any new details are immediately reflected in the documentations.

>Funny thing is, I'm even familiar with the mask function from using ZBrush in the past, but I still didn't twig on.
Well, if you're well-experienced with ZBrush, then you probably don't need any help in this area, I'm sure you'll be fine heh. :^)

>Thank you for compiling those links anon! 
Nprb. I have literally at least a hundred of those lists, it's been my plan to post them here if we ever get a general ''OC, Design, & 3D Art'' thread or something. Far too little attention is being paid to artistry on /robowaifu/ currently IMO.

>and maybe even make some kind of 'Robowaifu Laser Tag' vidya game.
You certainly appear to be well on your way to me Anon, M66 a cute!

# 21

# 22
>>11906
Lol, I just took my own advice and found that specific page has been moved.

https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.93/sculpt_paint/sculpting/editing/mask.html#clear-sculpt-mask-data

# 23
>>11792
Feet and helmets are easier to make imo. 

I have no idea how the asians know how many vertices to use along the jawline for the faces

# 24
>>11792
Dont forget to add the subdivision surface modifier to smooth out the overall shape of the model and shade smooth, otherwise you will have a blocky shape that won't look as good

# 25
Bit more progress on M66. Added the most similar hairstyle to that eighties-style floof that I could find. She looks a bit more like the character now. 

Realised for the first time that a lot of the finer robotic details will need to be painted/textured onto the model, because it's simply not feasible to cut/sculpt them in (poly count goes insanely high and the edges still look jagged). But this appears to be how many game assets are made anyway (relatively low-poly mesh with the fine details painted on top).

I'd like to say that I spent the most time sculpting her bum. However, it's actually her hands that are giving me the most trouble, because they are special robotic claws. So I had to make a normal hand, then shrink down all the digits so I could fit the claw parts over the top. Only done her nails so far.

# 26
Still stuck on the head, face and torso. have not implemented the hands yet,

# 27
>>11912
>Realised for the first time that a lot of the finer robotic details will need to be painted/textured onto the model
If you can import CAD designs from Blender or exported from other programs, then that would probably be the better option. Sculpting is for biological parts, CAD for technical ones.

# 28
>>11908
The simple rule at first is always:
>'''''Use the __minimum__ number of verts you can get away with, Anon.'''''
Less is always more when it comes to asset modeling, especially for character assets. Especially during the first pass! Try to figure out ways to ''remove'' vertices and edges whenever and wherever you can.

>>11909
Yup. Sub-D's are always important in the finishing up stage (#3), but I like to keep it simple earlier on. Gives you a better sense of the asset's impact on the animation/rendering systems, etc.

>>11912
Coming along nicely SophieDev -- she's going from cute to scary~! Materials and texturing can actually fill in gaps sometimes, yes.

>>11913
Wow, that's looking good Anon. Are you going for a real engineering design with her, or what? Thanks for sharing it, you seem to be making really good progress so far!

# 29
>>11915
Not him, but makes sense IMO. I think anyone working on designing robowaifus should have both SolveSpace and Blender in their tool-belts.

# 30
>>11920

It is an engineering design. 

I just cant find any good sculpting tutorial resources despite most of the blender community swearing its their pagan god. 

 "just learn anatomy bro" is the autistic non-response most of the blender community will give you when asking for a basic outline of how to start a head or torso for the first time. 

I can share an updated picture If interested.

The fingers of the hands were simple but its the palm that I am still trying to shape correctly and I re-did the torso again.

# 31
>>11944
Did you look into drawing tutorials?

# 32
>>11944
Don't get hung up on anything is the best advice I can give you Anon. That's one important -- but unstated -- goal of doing a character design in 3 different phases. You start very crude and blocky, but that's literally the easiest way to spot proportion errors (which is a notorious issue with human characters in particular). You get all the ratio and proportions right while it's still 'lego robowaifu'.

Then you start cutting in more details sufficient so you can start forming up the shapes (still crudely, but better than legos). Then put the whole thing aside for a couple of days and put it out of your mind.

Finally, come back with the aim of finishing up the low-poly model entirely. Only at that 3rd pass do you start cutting in smaller details like nails, hair, clothing, accessories of various sorts. This last phase can actually take a while depending how complex the model is, so just be patient.

By doing it this way, you really get comfortable with the character as you go along, and it's a lot easier to spot issues early this way, and you can fix them while it's still easy.

Sure, I'd always like to see WIP anon, insofar as myself goes.

# 33
>>11946
Oh I know how complicated it can be. 

Lol "lego robowaifu" makes sense since I had another design besides This one I was working on as well. 

Learned how to do braided hair and rigging from the other design but still don't have a actual head done for that design either. 

But at least I got better with Torso's in general from that one im chipping away at when I get hung up on a part here..

# 34
>>11948
That's a pretty cool-looking robowaifu Anon! Are those ball & socket joints for her hips? That's a really good idea for extra leg flexibility. I'm not quite sure what the ends of her arms do yet. Hey that's a neat idea having those rings for 'feet'. Seems like it would be pretty stable.

# 35
>>11951
The ends of the arms are only wrists for the moment/placeholders for where the hands should be and they are. 

Did not get around to fixing the hands yet.

I Will have to redo the torso again because I forgot to add a bit more of a curve to the back. Its all a matter of practice.

# 36
>>11953
Yes, hands are quite intricate actually. Challenging to get them just right IMO.

# 37
>>11974
Found Hands were not as hard as they were made out to be. Depends on the design and will refine them later.

Also fixed the cartoonish proportions of the arms and they look right to me and added a few more details and some color.

# 38
>>11988
OH I SEE NOW. The forearms look a little like gauntlet sleeves to me. Very cool. The hands look good, and in nice proportion, with the rest of the arms. Actually I really like where you're going with this robowaifu's design Anon, please keep it up!

# 39
I've been considering how difficult it will be to include silicone into my robowaifu and thinking of reworking her model into a more armored look or something like Aigis. Then I only have to worry about casting her face. It would also make accessing parts and prototyping much easier too.

And it would be fun to make a robowaifu fighting game kind of like Cyberspace Girls Colosseum: https://youtu.be/e1NR-Q2gc6w?t=392 Except instead of controlling the robowaifu you program her AI and battle against other people's. I've been pretty unmotivated to finish her model since I don't have any use for it right now until I get a 3D printer but if I made a battlewaifu game then I'd be working on it every day and exploring a variety designs.

# 40
>>11990
Well I did the head and torso today. Have to do the eyes, hair, texturing, and rigging. Did most of the head accessories too.
Thought it came out nice so far but have to find out why my pc has a burning plastic smell. The model as a whole is under 50k polys and I made the head and torso in a separate file...

Dont want to spam the board with my WIP pics and will show a fully assembled model After I add her hair.

No idea how to screw back on my 3D printer’s Extruder fan and I need to get some new tubing and a connector for it. The screws are super tiny and its not worth cutting myself by accident with the tiny chinesium tools since most actual hardware doesn’t go under 1 mm.

# 42

Cool anon! I like her forearms. Those look like they could double as laser cannons. A critical feature of any battledroid, whether robowaifu or not.

# 43
>>11915
>Sculpting is for biological parts, CAD for technical ones.
Good point and something I have come across at least once already when trying to draw a reference image for her chassis. CAD sketches look like a good way of creating accurate decals.

# 44
>>11988
Looking at this one, I can now see she has many design similarities to Aigis. Hope your PC holds out and we get to see more of her, anon!

>t/y

Are you planning to rig and animate her Anon? One of the nice things about hard-surface modelling is that weight-painting is really straight forward for most of the surfaces, so there's that.

Regardless, you deserve credit for finding your motivation spark. Keep it up! :^)

# 48
>>12116
Yes I am planning on rigging her so she is a playable character in Unreal Engine.

 Though Blender’s action editor is a huge PITA and I have no idea how to get the stash/ push down functions to work properly for more than 1 animation per model. Could not find a good tutorial on it.

I thought we had a 3dcg?

Will probably do more details tomorrow and go about fixing the hair bun.

# 52
>>12127
I'd also like a tutorial on this. I still have a hard time grasping how it works.

Most of my confusion was cleared realizing I need to have both the action editor and non-linear animation editor open at the same time. Pushing down puts the active action in the NLA editor as a strip on a track, which acts like a layer in an image editor. Each track modifies the modified track below it. Each strip is a bit of animation data on that track that references an action's keyframes and blends/extrapolates them. The active action being edited always sits on top of all the tracks.

Pressing N opens the context panel sidebar of the NLA editor which is important to have open, particularly the Strip tab where you can set the blending, extrapolation and playback scale of strips. Selecting a strip and pressing Tab in the NLA editor will enter tweak mode for its action, which will make it the active action being edited.

To get multiple animations, exporting as GLTF or FBX format will export each NLA track as an individual animation you can use in Godot and I imagine other game engines as well. I couldn't figure out the Godot exporter for animations. Each animation mode with it just merged them all together into one clusterfuck. I'm still not really sure how it all works but I think the NLA editor is just to help you blend and utilize existing actions to help create new tracks which get exported as individual animations, at least with GLTF and FBX, that can be blended together later in the engine if desired.

Well I added more details today and made a rough draft of the hair bun. A surprising lack of tutorials on those. Guess its because the same principles of straight hair and braids apply.  

Have not done the eyelashes yet because "Extrude along normals" does not appear in my context menu at all, not even the keybinds will work and I do have loop and meshtools enabled and also have to fix the hair.

I think I figured it out anon,Its also called "extrude region" and I took another look at the techniques I was using.

 Thank you for the help I appreciate it. 


 Also realized how complicated this might be to rig. not the humanoid parts, but the pivoting joints of the shoulder, elbow, hips, and knees. Will still get to it. But upon reflection it pretty much is the same principles of rigging a FPS weapon. 

Might have to look at how the Persona Devs rigged Labrys and Aigis for Persona 3 Dancing since Allie is a predecessor unit to Labrys and has most of the same parts.

# 61
>>12191
Well I took a look at the Labrys model from P3D. 

Apparently I made Allie correctly since Labrys has multiple objects in the same way and just uses a standard character rig.

Was odd that the fingers are a separate object from the hands and the obvious professional texturing where most of the detail was just drawn on.

Will have to make some adjustments to Allie based on what I learned.

# 65

Neat arms, How do they connect to her torso? Magnets?

>>12195
I made the eyelashes and a basic rig today. Did not parent it yet since I attempted to add IK for it starting with the legs and its a mess of conflicting info starting with most sources.

Looked further into how the P3D Devs made labrys and the hair had no subsurface modifier and was all merged into one object. Did they use a triangulate and decimate modifiers to make it lower poly? I'm not expert on hand drawn textures and will probably wind up re-doing the hair from a backup save I have and appending it to this version to get rid of the small gaps here.

# 66
>>12224
>Did not parent it yet since I attempted to add IK for it starting with the legs and its a mess of conflicting info starting with most sources.
If you're going for a ''full-body'' rig for Allie, then I would suggest starting the IK/FK chain with a single, unattached joint named ''Root'' that's located at the lower pelvis. All the other skeleton chains (spine, hips, ...) have this joint as their ultimate parent. Note: You do __not__ paint any weights for this joint Anon.

Having the master root joint makes it simple & straightforward to move the entire rigged model around at once, to properly place it in your scenes.

Sorry, I can't answer any of the studio questions you're curious about Anon.

Good luck! You're doing well.

>Very scary now
LOL I am glad. M66 needs to be somewhat scary. What better robowaifu to thrive during the creeping societal collapse of globohomo hellworld? (Being virtual she's also MUCH easier and cheaper for me to work on). 

>>12224
>How do they connect to her torso? Magnets?

In the anime OVA M66 appears to use pneumatic artificial muscles connected to an articulated metal endoskeleton (from what little I could see between her joints). Although, obviously she's not going to be a real-life robot so there's plenty of artistic license being used.  It's gonna be interesting trying to texture, rig and animate her. She's proving to be a fascinating training model.

Currently re-doing several parts of her mesh that I messed up when I first started. I can also see that the palms of her hands need more work. They shouldn't be as blocky as they are in that render. 

Model, pull back and review, then change and (hopefully) improve! Similar to the design, build, test, redesign iterative cycle.

# 68
>>12234
Well I decided to try and lower the polycount on Allie. No Idea how the hell Its up to 2 million polys mostly coming from the limbs without a subsurf modifier. The Entirety of the torso and head was less than 10k polys when I made it two weeks ago.

Though I started the arms a few months ago when I was still roughly green and learned many better techniques since then.

 Also am trying another design for practice. have not added the robotic parts yet as it took me a few hours to make the basemesh here so far. I improved on the mouth and collarbone area and no longer does Allie look like she has a CD Drive for a mouth anymore thanks to my practice here.

# 69
>>12354
Not him, but she's going to look really cool once you finish Anon. Those eyes are pretty neat tbh.

# 70
>>12357

Thank you anon! I have most of the parts ready for her, just need to finish the basemesh and append them into the scene.

Felt the eyes were kinda scary tbh after I added an emission to them. Will go over and mix it with an actual hand drawn image texture later for more detail like I did with Allie. Its just a generated texture for now.

>not him
wdym?

# 71
>>12358
Y/w. One thing I'd recommend is using a placard with reference images in the background during modelling Allie, Anon. This is really, really helpful to getting ratio and proportions correct. Just a suggestion.

Materials and texturing are like the cherry on top IMO. The foundation is all within the modelling itself. Anyway, I'm sure you'll craft Allie into something very interesting Anon.

>>12368
LOL. Art hater?

# 72
Lots of fixes and changes made but long story short, I've replaced her thorax completely so it's closer to the original M66 and fitted her attenae and a load of armor plates. She now almost has two "layers" - an internal and external.

I still kept a backup copy of her original large thorax though in case she ever needs to store more stuff...*chest compartment opens* "Medikit available!")

M66 was probably not a good choice for a beginner like me due to her complexity and the fact that her design changes between different reference images. In some of Masamune Shirow's original sketches and animation cells the scale and position of M66's armor plates and other components often change subtly (sometimes in ways that would completely obstruct a real robot joint). But then, he was producing hundreds of keyframes so this is only to be expected.

# 73
>>12393
She's looking really good, SophieDev. Coming right along. I'd say you have real talent and probably can become a pro at this if you wanted to and really set your mind to it. When do you think she'll be ready for your next steps?

>M66 was probably not a good choice for a beginner like me due to her complexity
It was indeed a bold **and obviously a good** choice Anon. You're clearly good frontiersman stock.
>and the fact that her design changes between different reference images
Heheh. Welcome to the real world of character arts in media! Staying ''on-model'' is a lot harder for the 2D guys ofc, so you've got it easier actually. :^)

Looking forward to M66 ~~assault gynoid~~ ''robowaifu'' 's further growth!

# 74
>>12395
Thanks anon, I appreciate your encouragement.

Final Fantasy has made me realise that there is no limit to what one can 3D model. From the humble barrels, boxes, lumber and logs to gigantic monsters, alien worlds and different dimensions. I will need to practice making lots of other things, but when imagination is your canvas and you see it as a hobby (and an escape from shitworld), it's easy to keep practicing.

As for M66, I have to finish her armor, organise the part-tree properly and then start adding color and detail textures. Might also mess about with some of those emission things that >>12358 anon mentions for her laser eye. Will have to see how it looks.

# 75
>>12354
This version of Allie is fucking terrifying (glowy red eyes in the darkness). She could potentially be Slenderman's robowaifu? Give her some long claws and she'd make an excellent ambush/close combat battledroid.

# 76
>>12411
>I will need to practice making lots of other things, but when imagination is your canvas and you see it as a hobby (and an escape from shitworld), it's easy to keep practicing.
Well, I may say you are already progressing well. Indeed it seems that a number of anons across the board seem to be releasing their creative spark lately. That's gratifying, and it's something I strongly encourage. Not only does it benefit each anon personally, but it also positions us as robowaifuists much better to devise original and innovative design and engineering.

Please keep it up, Anons.

# 77
>>12113
Hope your No.24 gets built. She has such a cool design in Persona. The circle feet are a great idea for stability. 
>>12393
You're making excellent progress SophieDev! If you're going to build her IRL, don't forget to add more space for the joints. I've learned through trial and many errors that designs need to incorporate generous clearance.

# 78
>>12426
Well I had done more practice on that design I shared a WIP of earlier over the last 2 weeks. Damn time flies. But she looks more human and less robot so was debating whether to post an update. Have not touched allie up since there must be a part of the techniques I am missing to lower the polycounts. 

Still haven't gotten around to rigging since blender has been extremely frustrating not only automatically rigging the spine bones to L or R, but also folding in on itself so no matter how I turn it. I can get it to look right, but its often 90 degrees the wrong direction and still labels the spine/center bones L or R and being a major PITA and wont even move the mesh after I've parented the bones. So I instead learned more techniques and added much more detail and some custom textures in a design a bit more advanced than with allie.

# 79
Here's a quick tip for body panels.

Use an edge split modifier with sharp edges ticked.
Solidify for some thickness.
Then use a subdivision modifier so you can get nice rounded body panels.

It's really quick and hassle free, non-destructive too.

That's assuming your topology isn't fugged.

Making those slices in her face in a technically correct manner, without it looking completely derp was harder than I thought. 

The normals kept on doing wierd shit and projecting ugly shadows all over the place. ​
I eventually fixed this though, first by flipping some normals, then  by selecting them  in Edit  mode and doing  > Mesh  menu > Normals > Average >  Corner Angle 


I checked in overlay mode that all of the mesh faces were facing the correct direction.

Next I have to get her uv seams setup, unwrapped and start doing some texture painting of details.

>>12500
That is an awesome robowaifu/battledroid anon! Very useful advice too. Will have to try it out, thank you!

Allieanon again, 

Are cyborgs off topic? Only reason I havent posted renders is because I thought it was OT. read the meta thread and saw that cyborgs were Ok.

The only challenge I have left is sculpting a hilt ornament for one of her accessories. Im no master sculptor. 

Also asking for a solution on how to fix the rigging issue in blender where instead of the skeleton symmetrizing Left to right after every bone is labelled except the center bones, it symmetrizes from the feet downwards....

Google did not help for me on this one.

# 88
>>13081
Cool design, I don't know much about blender but, maybe you're clicking on the wrong axis? Usually I model with the x axis being the point of symmetry.

# 89
>>13081
We don't really build cyborgs (yet) and this thread was about M66. Is it about how to model bodies?

# 90
>>13081
>Also asking for a solution on how to fix the rigging issue in blender where instead of the skeleton symmetrizing Left to right after every bone is labelled except the center bones, it symmetrizes from the feet downwards....
My guess just offhand is you need to go into the property settings for your mirror modifier and change the orientation for it?

# 91
Have uploaded everything I've done so far on M-66 to the file repository for Elfdroid Sophie which can be found here:

>>9216

It's the file 'M66_f11.blend'.

Feel free to do with her as you will.

Even though I really enjoy 3D digital modelling, I have had to put this on the back burner, because it just takes so much time. I need money if I am to get any kind of waifu (I doubt the Tesla robot will be cheap if it gets released). So I gotta spend my time on job-related training.

Thank you being an inspiration to do better with my own models and other Robowaifu engineers.

>>13088

I wound up duplicating the armature and mirroring it over the correct global axis I needed. 

Then since blender can be incredibly stupid at times, had to re-label the bones again back from "bone.R.001" to "Bone.L" when parenting/connecting the Left arm and leg to the skeleton and deleting the duplicate center bones.

BTW, I think Elfy would make a great little fairybot/moebot, SophieDev. Any plans for her beyond the modelling phase?

# 100
>>14283
She might make a derpy Christmas decoration?

Elfy is just a lot quicker to learn fundamentals with than the way more realistic and render-heavy m66 model (that still needs a lot of fixes and refinement because I made a lot of mistakes internally). I'm not yet skilled enough to texture paint, rig and animate m66, so I will learn on Elfy.

# 101
>>14303
People doing similar stuff to us, are the ones building animatronics. Mainly for Halloween and maybe more for their own parties. This might be a way for some of us to make money while still learning things useful to building robowaifus. It's different, but there are overlaps. Thought about this myself, designing some fancy pumpkin, which I could print during the year and then sell them  locally around October. Didn't do it, though. Just in case, we have a thread for that: >>3119

# 106
I realise the irony of me taking the piss out of the many bad Blender tutorials out there...then posting my own Blender tutorial. But this problem; mesh-to-rig parenting failure - had me stumped for days before I finally found the solution.

Position the bones of your rig to the appropriate joints on your character's mesh. I used the Rigify Blender add-on and chose the human meta-rig.

With that done, go into object mode and toggle X-ray view on (so you can see your rig inside your model).
Select the model mesh (this should be one single, joined solid object - not several different parts)

Shift + select your rig.

Ctrl+P to parent mesh to the rig 

Set parent to 'With Automatic Weights'.

Then go into Pose mode.

Select a bone. If it doesn't move or rotate the mesh when you press G or R*, then the parenting has failed.

A MAJOR REASON WHY PARENTING MESH TO RIG FAILS IS BECAUSE YOUR MESH IS TOO HIGH-POLY!

You will need to take a duplicate of your mesh (preserve the high-poly original), switch to edit mode and then select the Mesh menu, scroll down to Clean Up, and select Decimate Geometry. I tested it by going straight for a Ratio of 0.5 (halving the number of polys I guess?), and then when I parented this simpler mesh to the rig, it finally fucking moved properly!

The weights are shit and the mesh looks horrendous, but next steps are fine-tuning to see how many polys I can preserve before rigging failure occurs, and improving the weighting of individual bones.

* It helps to have the 'show gizmo' button near the top right corner of the 3D view (the curve with an arrow pointing through it) set so that all 'object gizmos' are showing; especially move and rotate. This way the x,y,z movement circles will appear when you select a bone.

# 107
>>14636
>>14638
Regardless of your trials with mastering her rigging, M-66 is looking quite nice SophieDev. Good job. Thanks for taking the time and posting your instructions here, I'm sure they will be helpful.

>A MAJOR REASON WHY PARENTING MESH TO RIG FAILS IS BECAUSE YOUR MESH IS TOO HIGH-POLY!
Weight-painting is an entire (and unusually tricky) sub-discipline within the 3D animation field. Don't be discouraged by your starts & stops with it. You are obviously more skilled already than 99% of the population at it. 
>and then when I parented this simpler mesh to the rig, it finally fucking moved properly!
So-called 'proxy meshes' are an important tool in the TD's toolbox, and are the main interface for animation artists, along with the control rigs they're given to use. You will eventually find an appropriate mechanism and control scheme to use SophieDev **if you just don't quit**.

You'll get there, just keep moving forward--she's gonna be amazing!  :^)

Cheers.

# 108
>>14641
Cheers mate! However hard 3D modelling and animation might be, it's currently the only way to make the robowaifu of your dreams. So that's a big motivator. (Unless you have tens of millions of dollars and access to a team of pro engineers, high-end CNC machines, dozens of different harmonic drives and a few hundred kilograms of titanium, aluminum and stainless steel).

# 109
>>14641
You are right about this being tricky. The automatic weights thing gives some very rough results so I am currently experimenting and so far I have an abnormally squishy little elf. The arms and legs work but everything else is a complete mess. Cannot just feel my way through this stuff. I am going to "deep-dive" into this and read a book or the sections of the Blender books I already have exclusively on rigging and weighting.

# 110

>(Unless you have tens of millions of dollars and access to a team of pro engineers, high-end CNC machines, dozens of different harmonic drives and a few hundred kilograms of titanium, aluminum and stainless steel)
Lol. If you are a refined, discriminating anon who will settle for nothing less than the toppest of top-tier AAA sci-hi-fi robowaifus. Ones that are the nothing less than the cuttingest of the cutting-edge!11 :^)

But some of us will be happy with just a cute ''Sumomo-chan-tier'' robowaifu to cheer us up with their kawaii little voices and quaint sayings. I remember some Anon who thought about the long-game for tech advances, and was willing to patiently and optimistically work towards that future. Where'd ''that'' guy go, SophieDev? (>>7693)

# 111
>>14661
I was just fantasizing over my ideal robowaifu scenario. Like what I would have made Sophie into if I was some big-shot CEO with money to burn (like Musk LOL). That's all. Ofc one guy with a 3D printer, no machine-shop, very little disposable income and cheap off-the-shelf parts will have to be content with something way simpler. On that topic; last I read even Elon's passion project is in deep shit because his "Raptor" engines won't work properly. I wonder if that will also mean no Tesla-bots? Eh, what can I say? It's a tough world. That's why I like M-66. She's properly tough like the Terminators or Men of Metal. No human frailty.

# 112
Starting to figure this out I think. Finally got joints moving cleanly without dragging random parts of the mesh along with them. Very glad I made simple model to experiment on because there's not a chance I would have been able to figure this out using my high-poly M-66 mesh.

When you parent the mesh with automatic weights, it produces anomalies such as the one in image attached where part of Elfy's body moves along with her arm (you can see the slight green weighting on her body - I did not paint that there - it was auto-generated by Blender). This is despite having the mesh in a T-pose with arms well away from the body when the armature was constructed. So I basically have to check every vertex group and see what kind of mess has happened with the weighting, then correct it. 

You can get some quite funny results with badly weighted facial bones though. It's similar to squashing the fat cheeks of a small child.

# 113
>>14674
Good job SophieDev, you're getting there. Grant Abbitt has a brief introduction to weight-painting in the fish and flags rigging segments of his ''Sea Shack'' tutorial series (>>12250). I recommend you have a look at that if you can make time to. But be aware: character rigging is far more technical and fiddly than the simple examples he gives. But you're obviously on your way.

Keep up the good work!

I have this mind-canon where elves all start out looking like chunky little children's toys. After 100 years they start to look less cartoony and more like human children. After several centuries they look teenaged (think Zelda and Link in BoTW or Deedlit in Record of Lodoss War) and after roughly 500 years they reach young adulthood (pic related).

Also, I can't get into the FFXIV servers at all at the moment. Too much congestion due to release of Endwalker. But at least I can see my character again now. I just like to spin her around on her turntable in the lobby and admire the texture work of the pros.

# 117

That's nice head-canon Anon, I like it! Seems like it follows pretty closely most of the Elven lore I've heard (well except for child's toy thing hehe).

Did you rig her hair SophieDev? I'd love to see this one animating tbh.

# 119
>>14699
Yeah, she has "hair-bones" now. Very strange concept. I wanna find out how they do more advanced hair textures because for now it's just one big sheet. I remember ages ago I made some hair using a physics engine in Z-brush but it looked like a mop made from wire and absolutely murdered my GPU.

There is so much I want to do, but due to work I can only "dabble" now and then. Not that I'm complaining. It's like that for everyone and I'm lucky to have a decent computer (GTX680 FTW LOL). Just gotta take it steady and learn one thing at a time. Like when ppl ages ago used to whittle those little wooden chess pieces - 'cept these models can glow and move about.

# 120
>>14702
Great insights Anon. If you can master both modeling and rigging as well, then I'd suggest you take on texturing and materials next.

# 121
In rare instances where the Elfy feels threatened or is exposed to the elements, it folds it's long, thick hair almost entirely around it's body. This provides the Elfy both protection from the cold, and a degree of camouflage. However, if an Elfy is forced to stay in this enveloped state for longer than a couple of hours, it's ears will fall off; only regrowing again later, once the threat has passed.

Finally solved this MF of a problem that was making the arms and hands of my mesh drag all over the place...I had left arm weighting all over the right arm, and left hand weighting on the right thumb! 

(Also, it took me a while just to realise that each vertex group specifically refers to only a single bone - if weight painting the upper arm left, you don't paint the entire left arm and hand. Only add weight to upper arm left. Noob mistake I know, but I caught on soon after I got automatic mesh weights working.)

The idea of battledroid robowaifus is really cool. Not only does it allow for really cool features like battling or even allowing them to fly by you also get to use more exotic designs when building them.

# 127
>>14977
Yup, the Japanons are masters of female battledroids. I remember in the early nineties TOMY released a series of toys called Z-Knights, which were all battledroids. I was fortunate enough to own one as a kid. I always thought Transformers were a little daft with the whole "disguising high-tech war machines as cars " thing. So I liked the Z-Knights more. They were all male I believe, but could still be another source for robowaifu inspiration. A female Z-Knight would be freaking awesome as well.

# 128
M-66 has learned me lots about character modelling Blender (mainly what not to do and then how to correct it). Consequently, despite extensive repairs and improvements, her basemesh topology is still rather fugged because I made so many mistakes while working on her. I have almost completed the process of getting her into a fully rigged and weighted state (just some cleaning up of a few more vertex groups still to do). But after more than six months, 488MB of models and 36 iterations I decided to give myself a bit of a rest from M-66 for now. 

Instead, I am starting the 'Honey Select to Blender Extraction Project'! Because the original 3D model for Sophie is still trapped inside Honey Select, which greatly limits where I can put her, what props she can interact with and how she could be animated. So I want to try and set her free from her mother-program by employing a combination of NinjaRipper, Noesis, the Blender knowledge I've gained working on M-66 and Marmoset Toolbag 4 for easier texturing.

# 129
>>15075
Lowering her poly count would be helpful. Be weary, game rips are designed to be used digitally. I have faith you can modify her design to work, just be mindful and careful when working with those designs.

# 132
That actually posted! Didn't think it would LOL.
As you can see I have been messing about uploading .OBJ files to Mixamo. I couldn't get any of the textures to work on Sophie because the texture map will not align to the UV. Not even sure this is doable in Blender TBH. Also, M-66's knees are glued together, both her shoulders have collapsed and it looks like some vertices on her arms are assigned to her spine or some shit XD. Other than that, cracking show.

# 133
>>15084
You have her looking pretty awesome I'd say SophieDev, really nice. Just track down the offending verts and get them weighted over to their correct bones. IIRC there's some kind of 'weight smooth' function?

You just need to tweak thinks a bit Anon. The UV unwrap looks clean AFAICT. Just twiddle things a bit to line up. Primarily you'll need to rotate the texture image CCW 90 degrees, then scale down & slide over the UVs to match up.

Good luck SophieDev!

I have reason to believe that Illusion has encrypted or scrambled it's UV maps. Because I was following the Youtube tutorial by LotusEyes on how to export characters from Honey Select, and he mentioned that Illusion assets have "encryption" to stop them being ripped and used by people in other games/projects. So you can only export heavily modded (non-Illusion) assets. Unfortunately, Sophie uses no such modded assets. This might explain why my head appears covered in a really scrambled up tooth texture when I load the raw RIP file. The head that LotusEyes uses on the other hand, appears a transparent light-grey, which he says is 'already UV unwrapped'.

This doesn't just happen on the head either. Every ripped mesh is covered in scrambled textures. Bummer. My only choice now would be to paint textures of my own, but I will not be able to get anywhere near the quality of those used by Illusion, whose skin textures appear photo-real.

Unfortunately I am unable to align the texture to the UV the way it unwraps from the ripped asset. I can get the eyes and nose and mouth aligned properly, but then because of the way the UV is shaped, the hairline and ears and inside of the mouth will be in completely the wrong place and vice versa. I think this is due to the UV data itself being scrambled because when LotusEyes shows his character's head UV, it is a completely different shape from the start, whereas mine starts off literally as a scrambled mess of lines and I have to press 'unwrap'. This gives the result above which looks like it might work, but when you come to position textures over it, they never fit properly. I will post some images later to explain the problem better.

I can align the texture for her eye sockets, nose and lips closer than in image 3 by scaling and transforming the UV map and by using UV > Minimise stretch, but then her ear textures end up on the back of her neck and her hairline is all wrong. Unless I'm missing some major Blender UV voodoo ritual, I think the asset encryption is the problem, because LotusEyes UVs are all fine from the get-go, and he makes no mention of any additional steps in his tutorial.

Ganbare SophieDev, your progress is great and you are on a path towards a beautiful future!

Since it looks like ripping Sophie's textures directly from Honey Select is out of the question, I will just keep focusing on M-66 and IRL-animatronic Sophie instead. Removed another 400KB of un-needed polys from M-66 the other day. She is getting close to being a single, smooth manifold basemesh now. I know you can use 'merge by distance' to eliminate unrequired vertices, but this often eliminates required vertices too, which ruins the design. So  I have spend a lot of time manually merging vertices and waging war on triangle-fans. 

The next model I make I'll be much more careful which shapes I place where and delete non-visible internal polys as I go along.

Battle waifu robots would be really cool to see. Bonus points of they're maids too! 

But what kind of weapons could a robowaifu use? If you live in the US you could give them a firearm but if you're in Europe or another country you could probably only give them something like a taser or a sword, maybe a crossbow.

(I actually want to learn to crotchet at some point because you can make some cool stuffed toys using that technique. Although it is pretty skilled and takes a lot of practice. I could mount a couple of micro-servos into such a stuffed toy similar to Tickle-me-Elmo. Complete opposite end of the spectrum to M-66, I know. But this is broad-spectrum robowaifus!

A cute! Elfy is a good idea IMO as a more 'low-impact' waifu design that brings lots of benefits to the table for newcomers in particular SophieDev **I'm __not__ meaning you or any other regulars here haha ~~except me perhaps~~**. Simpler lines, volumes, movements, etc.

BTW, you might investigate what the pony community is doing along these lines. Not only have they reached out to us here more than once (>>8118, >>1563, >>11024), but there are probably some of them already doing plushie-oriented work there.

Ofc our own dear Kiwi-chan waifu design also pretty closely related too (>>104)
