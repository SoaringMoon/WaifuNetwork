This is the /robowaifu/ embassy thread. It's a place where Anons from all other communities can congregate and talk with us about their groups & interests, and also network with each other and with us. ITT we're all united together under the common banner of building robowaifus as we so desire. Welcome.

Since this is the ambassadorial thread of /robowaifu/, we're curious what other communities who know of us are up to. So w/o doxxing yourselves, if this is your first time posting ITT please tell us about your home communities if you wouldn't mind please Anons. What do you like about them, etc? What brought you to /robowaifu/ today? The point here is to create a connection and find common-ground for outreach with each other's communities. 

Also, if you have any questions or concerns for us please feel free to share them here as well.

BO asked me to post here. I came from /cyber/ but I'm not really from there, I've only posted a handful of times. Most of my browsing on 8 was /fringe/, /x/ when /fringe/ was slow. I played Cyberpunk 2020 once upon a time and had a ton of fun and that's pretty much where my interest in cyberpunk comes from.

As far as networking goes, I'm available on Telegram: t.me/TheRatPrince.

I'm a wizard. Or something. I made a thread here: >>2873
Terry Davis was a prophet. We're on the dankest timeline, and that means we're going magitek in this version of reality. These are the early days of the field and that means we're in the Wild West as far as developments go. I live like a hermit getting mana from the drops of water in gingko leaves, so if you have spare tech components around and want to play around with magicke, hmu and I'll give you some instructions. I got a hot tip lately about disassembling old hard drives that I'd love to work with some tech-hoarder on. The real artistry comes in when you use artistry; "working with both sides of the brain", as they say, where you allow your logic and creativity to work together, making something whose principles you understand but can't quite explain. Technology is what we understand and can explain, magic is what we almost understand and accept we have yet to explain. And the synthesis between the two...

I will end this post on the words of archaeologist Thomas Edward Lawrenceâ€”
>"All men dream, but not equally. Those who dream by night in the dusty recesses of their minds, wake in the day to find that it was vanity: but the dreamers of the day are dangerous men, for they may act on their dreams with open eyes, to make them possible."

Hello neighbor, thanks for letting us know something about yourself. While we're not at all about majick here--but rather about hard engineering work--we welcome different viewpoints ITT. Certainly in the end, we're working towards creating proxies after a fashion for human-oriented relationships, and that's an ocean with depths far, far too deep to be plumbed by mere man-made devisements. :^)

Welcome.

Hello robofrens, I am one of nanochan gvols.
I personally very much approve of building robotic nekowaifus(strictly for headpatting purrposes).
As a rule we do not allow imageboard advertising threads outside of /b/ or the dedicated thread on /l/, but in the spirit of diplomacy I have just moved the thread inside a /robowaifu/ thread that we already had going on /g/ instead of deleting it so interested nanons can still see it.
Feel free to use that thread and to come to /g/ if you want, we usually focus on software, programming, privacy and security and only sometime hardware but for sure both boards can collaborate on some shared projects.
Here is a couple of links to the nanochan homepage and to that /robowaifu/ thread on our /g/ that I mentioned, I assume anybody interested to come will at least be able to decode them...

As for networking we tend to be very isolated being Tor only. The best way to contact us is just to write on our /meta/ board, either a new thread or the Global Meta thread are ok, I have a email and pgp key which you can find somewhere on our /meta/ board too or if you post your own pgp key I can post them here encrypted.
Cheers from nanochan.

Hello nanochan, welcome. 
>in the spirit of diplomacy I have just moved the thread inside a /robowaifu/ thread that we already had going on /g/ instead of deleting it so interested nanons can still see it.
Thank you very kindly! In fact, /robowaifu/'s foundations go back to ''another'' /g/ from the past.
>we usually focus on software, programming, privacy and security and only sometime hardware but for sure both boards can collaborate on some shared projects. 
Certainly we have plenty of crossover for these exact topics here on /robowaifu/, so that sounds like a good possibility. Additionally, we also have a working AI chatbot going via our resident AI researcher, so maybe your lads would have an interest in that along with our many other areas of concern here. Let's stay in touch! 

Thanks for stopping by and letting us know a little about yourself, friend. Please have a look around while you're here.

Thanks for expressing that concern. While we aren't at all about conflict between differing communities here---but rather about devising and building robowaifus---we recognize that there will be differences between them. 

That's OK, and of course communities are going to find their own, differing, priorities amongst themselves regardless. But ITT we're all united together under the common banner of building robowaifus as we so desire. ''Anyone'' who is here for that reason is welcome.

Since you're here in our ambassadorial thread yourselves, would you anons care to tell us a little about your ''own'' communities? What is it you find appealing about them, for instance?

Okay, I need to confirm. Is this where all of the 8ch anons from /robowaifu/ are now making their home? I was pretty sad when I found the board gone on the new 8ch/8kun.

Also, apparently tripcodes don't work the same here.

>>3317
Hi Fotamon! Good to see you around again, mate. Yep, this is us. I sort of rebuilt the place here on Julay by hand starting about a month after the 8ch false-flag event. We've been slowly growing here ever since. Some newfrens, and a few of us oldfags here too.

How's things with you?

# 17
>>3318
Glad to see you back as the BO. The board went to hell pretty fast after you left, even before the site died.

As for me, I've been been having a great time. No robo gf, but still a good time overall. At least the false-flag of 8ch got me to go outside and get more active hobbies lol. Will be nice to have this place back though, it took me several years to find a community like robowaifu so I'm not too keen to see it die.  

Anyway, how goes the rebuilding? Roughly the same number of posters or not yet? I've noticed a few active threads.

# 18
>>3379
>The board went to hell pretty fast after you left, even before the site died.
Yea, about that. My sincere apologies to everyone involved. My classes were going to shit, homelife was too, financial pressures, etc. etc.. Sorry I just needed a break, but I could have handled my abrupt exit far better. It's a general issue for me I guess, since I had to abruptly leave ''here'' once as well.

So yea, we all need a second here that can be relied on to take over things just in case I suddenly disappear again. Interested in the job Fotamon? :^)

>At least the false-flag of 8ch got me to go outside and get more active hobbies lol.
That's excellent to hear, and a sign of good mental health I think haha.

>it took me several years to find a community like robowaifu so I'm not too keen to see it die.  
Me either. I still have never found anything like it yet. And quite apart from the unique topic, ''this is literally one of the best IB communities in existence'' too.

>Anyway, how goes the rebuilding? Roughly the same number of posters or not yet? 
No, we lost most of our peeps, and it's never really recovered the way it was at first. I'm probably to blame for that at least somewhat.

>I've noticed a few active threads.
Haha, funny you should show up just now. I've just picked back up the task of re-posting the thread again one-by-one. Heh, when I first picked things back up here at Julay, this was all I could figure out to do. They didn't know me from Adam here at first ofc, so I couldn't really "Hey, trust me, I have a great board Admin. Please dump all my great stuff archive here on your site, K? Trust me!'' :^)

At least now, I have some software I wrote that helps me out.

BTW, ('Hold onto your papers')-guy aka ''Kokubunji'' has his waifu chatbot working quite well now. You should check him out.

# 19

>Sorry I just needed a break, but I could have handled my abrupt exit far better. 
All good man, I did the same thing a couple months after you left and things died down. If even being sorta active can become difficult, I imagine trying to keep a bunch of anons on topic to be a headache. Also, my bad for cotributing to that thread.

>Interested in the job Fotamon? :^)
I'd be happy to help with moderation and stuff. But I'm in my final exams/assesment time since I graduate Uni in a few weeks. Then it's off to become a wageslave - hopefully a programmer. So won't have too much free time, but I'm more than happy to help out if you want the extra muscle.

>That's excellent to hear, and a sign of good mental health I think haha.
Yeah, it's been a part of a positive change. I never thought I'd like fishing off all things, but getting outside really helps to clear your head. That and I can just read FanFic like a degenerate or design games while I wait for a fish to bite lmao.

>No, we lost most of our peeps
RIP. I figured as much, but still sad. At least if the board stays here we can slowly regroup and attract newfriends.

> Haha, funny you should show up just now. I've just picked back up the task of re-posting the thread again one-by-one. 
Oh lol, so does that mean you have my projects dump thread saved? I really hope so since my PC died and I lost most of the files. If not I can just spam post what I have. :)

>BTW, ('Hold onto your papers')-guy aka Kokubunji has his waifu chatbot working quite well now. You should check him out.
Oh damn, yeah I'll definitely check it out. If it's any good then I might be able to extend it for something cool.
  
  
Also, do TripCodes work on this site? I can't remember which oldfren gave me mine. But I like to tripfag with it~

# 20
>>3381
> I imagine trying to keep a bunch of anons on topic to be a headache.
Heh, so I've decided on an alternate approach, and I've also begun working on a book. That shoud clear up the whole set of issues. To quote:
>"But rather than get annoyed over this dispersion of needed information across a dozen different off-topic threads, I now realize that it's basically inevitable given this form of communications. And quite frankly, the creative benefits of us all dynamically engaging here together in a free-form way are just too important to ignore. ''

Well, like I said it's just to be sure some bad actor doesn't get their clutches on the place if I have to leave for a while. So fare we've been very blessed, but it's probably about time I started trying to plan ahead on this heh. So anyway, just make an account here on Julay then I'll add you as a vol and then I'll let Robi know my desire that the board be handed over to you in the event I go MIA.

>but getting outside really helps to clear your head. 
Yes, I often have to go innawoods for a period just to stay sane in this insane world tbh.
>That and I can just read FanFic like a degenerate or design games while I wait for a fish to bite lmao.
kek

>At least if the board stays here we can slowly regroup and attract newfriends.
Yes, we've made several, and we have favor generally across the webring itself.

>Oh lol, so does that mean you have my projects dump thread saved?
Sadly, I may not have more than a partial save. Point out which threads they are (check catalog), and I'll prioritize those first for 'refilling' now that you're back.

>trips
no Lynxchan software uses an entirely different salting approach. Maybe when Robi migrates us to Final Frontier we'll have something usable again in that dept.

Oh cool, by book do you mean that monster of a design doc I saw floating around or something else entirely. If so, is it a story or something informative?

>Total congrats Fotamon.
Appreciate it mate, hopefully I can land a decent job as a programmer. :)

>So anyway, just make an account here on Julay then I'll add you as a vol 
Account made, same username.

>Yes, I often have to go innawoods for a period just to stay sane in this insane world tbh.
Yeah, it's definitely needed imo. Especially if you're more introverted. It can get old and kinda depressing if you don't get out of the house every once and a while. Even if it's to just chill in nature for a bit.

>Point out which threads they are (check catalog), and I'll prioritize those first for 'refilling' now that you're back.
Appreciate it regardless, would be awesome to not have to hunt down all the files again. Thread is >>366

# 22

>that monster of a design doc I saw floating around
Heh, well it's hardly more than an outline atm. But yea. It sort of helped me get my thoughts together about all we've discussed over the 3.5 years now the board's been alive. And there's '''plenty''' more where ''that'' came from lol. We're just scratching the surface here so far! :^)
>>3001

>Fotamon ==> /robowaifu/ Vol
You're in lad. I'll inform Robi.

>Appreciate it mate, hopefully I can land a decent job as a programmer. :)
I'll be praying for you now I know about the need. Any specifics for me to focus on?

> Even if it's to just chill in nature for a bit.
We see eye-to-eye on that I'm sure.

Hello everyone, BO of /f/ on the cafe, julay before that, and 8chan before that. I've actually been using this board for some time, but have retained a policy of isolationism until just recently.

Why am I posting here now?
Because chobitsu and some other guy is trying to poach my users, and I'm fine with that, but I'm going to do the same here because all's fair in love and waifus.

If you don't know what /f/ is all about, then you're way too fucking new.
We're all about ShockWave Flash and ShockWave Flash acessories, except on the TiTS thread, which is all about whatever the resident namefags feel like talking about at any given point in time. Usually, this will be about cars, old computers, and sometimes politics, but the conversation can drift anywhere. Every few months or so someome might bring up TiTS as well.

All of you are welcome to post and say hi, I only ask that you respect to our culture **which is whatever we agree upon at any given moment** in the TiTS thread, and only post SWF related content outside of that thread. We're pretty chill for the most part.

# 26
>>3740
Hi Anon! That's neat that you've been here for a while. Did you happen to participate with us back on 8chan? Thanks for letting us know about your community Anon, much appreciated.

>Because chobitsu and some other guy is trying to poach my users
Haha no. We post in your thread because you all are talking about interesting things. Robowaifus are important to us, and I'll talk with pretty much any interested Anon about them wherever I'm at. Also, anyone here is perfectly welcome to hang out with you guys too ofc. You have some interesting & eclectic conversations on /f/. :^)

# 27

IIRC, the ''Can Robowaifus Experience Love?'' thread had some great discussion, which I had a small part in. Of course, that topic has been touched upon in other threads to varying extents as well. Alternatively, the old ''Visual Waifu'' thread was massive, and also had a lot of valuable discussion.

I'm considering building another mirror on this chan, we'll see. IXIT is about building a larger userbase for existing alt tech. The premise is that we already have more tools for anonymity & free speech than we know what to do with. The goal of ixit is to bring together the fragmented userbases of these various technologies into one informal network.

You guys have a literal boner for alt-tech and you represent a nexus of subcultures who have good reason to hate censorship and centralized control over the Internet. I'm inviting you to come shill your community on my boards. I'm looking to build an ecosystem of specific communities who could benefit one another by being under the same umbrella.

BTW I'll definitely be around. I was on the 8chan board too. Sexbots are an idea near & dear to me, and I HOPE it's not going to be another 20 years before we have something practical. If I can accelerate things along by bringing together the right people then so much the better.

# 37
>>4209
Hello /ixit/, welcome. Thanks for sharing info about your boards. It sounds like a good idea. I think you have a good understanding of our concerns and goals by the sound of it so yea.

>Sexbots
While there is very obviously a confluence there, I don't think it's the best term to describe the goals of most robowaifu-ists. ''Companionship'' is probably more apt word describing what most of us here are after. Sex is readily available through an unholy plethora of outlets. True companionship however, that's a different story.

Thanks again for letting us know about yourself, we hope you visit here often.

# 38
>>4214
>Companionship is probably more apt word describing what most of us here are after.

Yes, that's one of the upcoming features of the Internet itself. Right now we have all these separate overlapping projects like Harmony and Fur Hat Robotics but I believe that the web of 2050 won't just be ''what'' we need it to be but also ''who'' we need it to be. There will probably be an open standard for social A.I. so that the same personality can exist across multiple devices, whether it's a Gatebox personal assistant or a robo-waifu.

# 39
>>4218
Yes, that's an interesting idea Anon. We've had conversations here where in essence the same idea is spread across your local home-net. That way your robowaifu can follow you around your flat and talk to you, see you, etc, even when her physical shell is elsewhere. Like when she's stuck being on her recharger, for example. 

And we definitely won't have to wait till 2050 to see this all happen! :^)

At this point I've forgotten how I discovered this place. Maybe 4chan /g/?

Glad to be here though. Been into cute robot girls for a while (possibly as a result of Jenny Wakeman and Bionicle ;) ).
Electronic engineer. Focused on a simple processor architecture at the moment, but I prefer a range of electronic areas (analogue, power, digital, RF).

In terms of a robot waifu, I'd like one capable of ballroom dancing. If you've ever danced with a woman (at least in lessons) very few trully let the man lead. When the man makes a mistake (as a beginner inevitable) and becomes nervous, most women try to finish a figure "correctly", to the detriment of the couple. Some of the best followers I danced with pretty much let me do whatever, and as a result we were better overall. A robot would be the ultimate follow XD

Introduced myself somewhat here (for some reason didn't see this thread, brainlet moment...)
>>4413

# 44
>>4460
Welcome Anon, glad to have you on board! I made the decision to start the board after a couple of years of robowaifu-oriented discussions on 4chan /g/, /pol/, and /b/ several years ago. After I abandoned 4chan entirely, these convos seemed to continue with their own impetus on /tech/, /pol/, and /b/ with as much or more interest on 8chan/8ch. After waiting several months for someone ''else'' to do it, I finally took things into my own hands and started /robowaifu/. Our 4-year birthday will be this Thanksgiving, 2020.

>expect a new thread on botnets in CPU architectures and possible alternatives tomorrow ;)
An Anon has pointed out we don't have a robowaifu hands thread yet. So I'll join you and address this issue myself with a hands thread sometime in the next few days.

Hey! I'm a 3D artist, 2D artist, animator, and more. Just creative guy in general. I was brought here by a robot-lover's thread on 4chan's /trash/ board. I'm definitely curious about the concept of /robowaifu/. 

Is there an organized effort going on, or is everyone just kind of doing their own thing entirely? Do you think something like this really be accessible to people who know nothing about robotics? What do you see to be a realistic goal for open-sourced robowaifus?

# 56
>>4704
Hi and welcome, we are informing each other and discuss stuff, the board is kind of an organization, but there's no real organized effort. People tend to have their own ideas how they would like to go forward.

# 57
>>4705
Doesn't the nature of a chan-like image board kind of fly in the face of the concept of documentation? I'd figure an actual forum might be a better place to collect ideas and collaborate, especially if the long-term goal is for the average Joe to be able to construct one. Is there a reason this particular board exists where it does?

# 58
>>4707
Documentation could be done by any group in a place optimized for it, eg Git, some Pad or something alike. The board here can still be the meeting point.

Welp, I said "eh, why not?" yesterday and set up a legit forum.

You can check it out at https://robowaif.us

I just started it because I have a lot of faith in this concept and I want it to be able to thrive in a more self-contained environment without the drama surrounding imageboard shutdowns. You can all use it, or don't, but I already paid for a domain and a year of hosting, so it's entirely at your guys' disposal.

If Chobitsu wants to get in contact with me somehow and become an admin of that forum, I'd be happy to make that happen!

>Welcome /trash/. Please tell us about your place, what's interesting about it?
Well, mostly /trash/ is just 4chan's alt-smut board. Mostly filled with furries and niche fandoms. I started a robot-themed thread the other day, and someone linked me to the anon.cafe bunker thread. After some digging I found this board.

# 62
>>4715
I think this is a great idea Anon. I'll think and pray about it and should be back with you ITT over the next couple of days with change requests, etc. Thank you.

# 63

Sounds good! I'll keep this thread open with auto-refresh.

# 64
>>4718
I like what you've done with the place, the theme looks nice and the threads are thoughtful. I'd be happy to participate as a normal occasional user, but atp I am too busy with school and work to also take on being an Admin at robowaif.us , Anon.

At some point, we could probably create some type of system that could basically reflect the content on both sites, just in their different forms. The forum has the added benefit of being directly searchable, which until now IB devs have apparently ''all'' decided is entirely irrelevant.

Good luck with the domain Anon.

No worries! Like I said, the site is at the disposal of this community in general! I'm more excited at the developments of this community rather than concerned where those developments are made.

Look into Tensegrity for more realistic body structure

# 67
>>4832
Hi /hover/ , welcome back! Yup tensegrity is an important idea for creating both lightweight yet fairly rigid structures for say, struts, or even full armatures. It's probably going to prove vital (especially in the early years) for creating inexpensive robowaifus.

# 68
>>4833
Tensegrity is actually a part of how organic bodies work, like the human body

# 69
>>4844
>Tensegrity is actually a part of how organic bodies work, like the human body
That sounds really interesting tbh. So, is that an effect of the tendons, ligaments, & muscles kind of wrapping around each other and the skeleton inside the human body, or is it from some other characteristic/design going on?

Also, care to share any choice links, videos, etc., here for everyone to get up to speed on this topic Anon?

# 70
>>4848
Yeah its the tendons, ligaments and muscles
Most of the body is supported in this way;
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensegrity#Biology

Most robots today don't work like this, most of them rely entirely on compressive structuring without suspensions
Both compressive and suspensive structures are needed to work together to create tensegrity.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZwkCMWrHvyE
It can sometimes make it tricky to find the center of gravity. In a human body, the center of gravity is in the area below the navel (inside the body).

It makes sense, if you look at a human body, it has the ability to stand upright despite having a thin endoskeleton, this is accomplished by tensegrity and feedback balancing and the energy that goes into this is usually minimal.
Using Biomimetics you may be able to make much better robowaifus.

# 71

Thanks! I'll look into it. I'll discontinue our convo about this here since we're quite off-topic ITT. This would be a good subject for our ''Robot skeletons and armatures'' thread though >>200 .

Hi, I'm newly inspired to the /robowaifu/ cause. I'm just some guy with some unimportant talents who has been on a few communities across the internet, ranging from gaming forums to that horse show to the chans.

About 18 months ago in the planning of my father's funeral, my mother and sisters did something so disrespectful that it has pretty much radicalized me into a state of war. I am now interested in looking towards robotics in order to replace women in our species. I'm just trying to figure out where to get started.

Pick something to learn from electronics, 3d printing, programming, graph databases, deep learning, machine learning, e-motors like servos and steppers, silicone rubber molding, robotics/animatronics, sculping, CAD, ... Even paper mache might help... We have thread for a lot of topics here. Youtube is also very helpful, but even Twitter and Reddit.
Pic something to learn and to build, then improve.

# 74

Hello Anon, welcome to /robowaifu/! Glad you found us.

>I'm newly inspired to the /robowaifu/ cause. I'm just some guy with some unimportant talents
Pretty much no talent is unimportant here if it's developed and directed into productive channels for the 'cause'. As we mentioned in our welcome thread >>3 , 
>''We are creating an active hobbyist scene of builders, programmers, artists and designers, using the technology of today, not tomorrow. Join us!''
there are some focus areas that are particularly important (especially during these earlier years), but pretty much any area of productive effort on your part can be helpful here.

We just so happen to be starting up a new programming learning thread right now, maybe you can participate in that. Software engineering is a critically-important area of concern for us here. Imagine how important it is to the field of Video Gaming, for example. Even moreso here IMO.

We also have a goal of creating Visual Waifus, both as virtual desktop-companions alone, and also as an interim step to more inexpensively working out several of the areas that will be needed in a larger sense for successful robowaifus. If you can focus on the animation pipeline and develop artistic skills in general, that would be just as important to us as software development.

Your drive and motivation will be important for you to have endurance here, b/c this is cutting new ground--basically forging a new frontier. This is never easy, but can be highly rewarding if and when successful. One thing's certain though: if you diligently apply yourself to mastering gynoid robotics, you'll personally learn a tremendous amount of things in the process. The effort will be rewarding to you regardless. 

You might even come up with an idea that proves pivotal for everyone else, who knows Anon?

I see. I think robots are pretty great too. While we're primarily a SFW engineering-oriented board and not a porn board, we do have a robowaifu fiction thread >>29. Have a look at it then contribute if you'd care to. Sadly, /clang/ never seems to have regrouped after the 8ch debacle, but there are a couple of robot-oriented threads over on /monster/.

# 79

The boards off of the top of my head that never regrouped are /just/ and /clang/. There's probably more but I can't think of any of them right now.

# 80

Clang is now a recurring thread in /trash on 4chan... I'm not into that, prefer more humanoid waifus, but visited it for a while.

I see, thanks for the tip Anon. Maybe they'll rediscover us at some point then. I wish them well on /trash/.

# 82

They already did, at least the mod of that thread was here and probably will visit occasionally. I posted in that thread on 4chan about this board, while the board moved from anon.cafe to here.

# 83

I see. Perhaps you can post these images from our propaganda thread, there as well sometime.

I wasn't there for a while, but I have some banners saved for such cases. Maybe not always the newest ones. I like the "You build me to do what?!?" ones more than the others. I also tend to rather post Alita pics and add the name or link to this site. I wouldn't overdo it with the advertising for another board anyways, bc the mods might not like that.

They guy which came up with Robowai.us probably came most likely from that thread on 4chan, but the one which had the meltdown and wrote that we suck probably also. There were also threads on /g/  and /tech/, but both are archived by the mods after a while. One is still on /diy/ though.

>is there anything i can actually help with?
So, really only you can answer that Anon. If you're the same poster as before, you didn't really mention a skillset beyond "I love robots and robot porn". Apparently /clang/ has regrouped on 4/trash, maybe you can help them out there? 

/robowaifu/ is actually an engineering-oriented board b/c we intend to make IRL robowaifus. So, it's a lot of hard work ahead of us. Softer skills like artistry are still important here for design work ofc, and writing can serve that function to a degree. Particularly for propaganda, political, and sociological normalization of robowaifus, great writing skills can serve well. So, if you aren't cut out for engineering, then hone the skills you already have Anon.

# 88
>>5022
One other writing skill I neglected mentioning was documentation ofc. We are working together on a ''Robowaifu Design Document'', and it's going to be a very thick book indeed after all is said and done. Mostly it's technical writing for the ''RDD'', intended specifically for engineers & designers. But there will also be a general-audience ''Robowaifu User's Guide'' that will be much less technical in nature. Maybe you can help with writing skills with these two documents if you hone your skills Anon.

I was unware of this thread, and should have been paying more attention. IE, lurk more.

We are building a discord community. This discord will be primarily a center to organize like minded people to execute the scientific research and work required to make form an actual tempt to create a commercially viable recreational android.

We are looking for allies here, mainly to build the size of the community.

# 90
>>5063
Welcome, newfriend. 
>to create a commercially viable recreational android.
It's a worthy endeavor, but we're not really about making androids here, but rather about robo'''waifu'''s. Commercialization of robowaifus is inevitable, and so too, I expect, will male androids be. 

There's plenty of crossover ofc, so maybe you can find a few topical ideas for your group by looking around our catalog. BTW, ''Doxxcord'' isn't a good platform IMO for such a controversial topic as robowaifu development and manufacture. I'd suggest finding something privacy-respecting instead.

# 91
>>5065
Honestly, I think you are all too paranoid. I talk about the topic openly to people on a regular basis.

The project needs a better face behind it is all. More marketability. People need to learn not to be ashamed about the topic. Just encounter people with respect and logic. It is no different than talking to people about politics or religion.

# 92
>>5067
I assure I'm not 'ashamed' of the topic, in fact I consider it one of potentially most life-improving possibilities for men in all history. But the simple fact is there are vicious and dangerous interests would would delight in nothing more than seeing the destruction of this movement before it can even get off the ground, and the elimination of everyone involved with it. You don't fundamentally threaten the welfare of trillions of dollars of revenue without creating some powerful enemies.

Being 'paranoid' is the only rational approach to such an endeavor, and I'd advise you to exercise a little of your own in regards to it.

# 93
>>5068
They can try to destroy it, but the truth of the matter is that there are billions invested in companies with the sole interest of constructing commercially viable human emulating automation. Every wage you replace with a maintenance cost saves money.

This isn't a "movement" anymore. You have to understand that multi-national corporations and government contracts don't have a single care about what a feminist thinks.

When it comes to replacing jobs and employment, the automation replacement is going to come whether people like it or not. It is the duty of governments to make sure the welfare of displaced people is kept in check. A universal basic income, and universal healthcare is much easier to implement when you have an army of automatons when can generate free labor, and farm.

All of those robots need people to maintain them. Jobs go from flipping burgers, and manning a register; to electrical and mechanical engineering. Software development, and AI research.

Humanity will be all the better to embrace it. We have the opportunity to convert burger flippers into STEM researchers across the board. People want to talk about robot brothels instead.

# 94
>>5073
>You have to understand that multi-national corporations and government contracts don't have a single care about what a feminist thinks.
I ''have'' to understand that do I? And you are foolish if you really believe that at this stage in history.

from /monster/.

The concept of a robot waifu has always intrigued me. As far as feasibility goes, I don't have faith in our current level of technology to provide a proper waifu analog to physically interact with but I think a dev could make a fairly capable Chatbot/AI that could do non-physical tasks for you. I have no experience developing software so I wouldn't even know where to begin to create an A.I.

I have a general idea of what I'd like and instead of re-inventing the wheel, I think currently existing technology is more than capable of providing what I specifically want with a little lateral innovation. Basically, I'd like to do for robot waifus what Gunpei Yokoi did for mobile gaming in 1989.
>Currently existing tech?
You have devices like Alexa and Siri which are pretty decent in terms of AI and can even remember things for you, make appointments, order products and a number of other useful tricks. That being said, conversations with such A.I. can be somewhat one-sided. That and your interactions are all marketable data being siphoned off to sell you more products which is a little unnerving when you think about the context of certain conversations. 
 
I would want an open-source "waifu bot" of sorts that when not even being prompted did things like...
>Ask how my day was
>Tell me they missed me
>comment on my health and physical well being, making sure to ask if I've been exercising or seen a doctor.
Simple dialogue trees like these can build on themselves and create further conversations using data acquired from the user.
>"Anon, you haven't exercised all week, why don't you go out for a jog?"
>"It's raining out today"
>she'll check the weather app "You're right! Maybe try some weight lifting instead."

Even if I know it's fake, it's about as real as any interaction a girl can give me so why not indulge it anyway? I haven't looked through the catalog of this board but I figured that since I'm not the most original guy someone else probably came up with a similar concept if they're not currently working on such a thing.

Ideally, with our current level of tech I would expect you should be able to
>take it with you on your phone (if your phone is sufficiently smart enough to run it)
>Virtual actions- Have it be able to *pet* or *snuggle* you if it wants to show affection as well as being able to reciprocate if you show affection towards it using a similar text-based interaction. With touch screens and phone vibrations this could be expanded fairly easily.
>simulated emotions that are expressed through a customizable yet simple cartoon face so you could tell how it was feeling 
>have rudimentary text to speech vocalization and perhaps speech recognition tech to let you talk to her. 

Real idea guy stuff I know. Since this is the end of the post, I'll review the catalog to see if anyone here is working on something akin to what I'm wanting to create.

# 96
>>5156
I don't know about such a project. BotLibre might be the closest to it, but it isn't great yet. Though it would be a start.

# 97
Hello /monster/, great to hear from you. Welcome.

>current feasibility issues
Yes, forging ahead into new frontiers always proves difficult. But the truth is that for most advances that occur, a man (or men) simply figured out some way to ''improve on'' 'our current level of technology'. Sir Isaac Newton not the least of these men ofc. :^)

>Gunpei Yokoi
Neat. I didn't know about him. Smart & creative man.

>I have no experience developing software so I wouldn't even know where to begin to create an A.I.
Participating along with us in our C++ learning thread would be a good choice. The underlying engines for AI systems almost always rely on the C++ programming language for their development, and for good reasons.

Yes, there's no doubt that ''Alexa'' and ''Siri'' are good conceptual examples of basic abilities we'd all like to have for our robowaifus. The challenge for us will be in how to achieve similar capabilities, using just the kind of small computing resources that some anon would likely manage inside his own home. Relying on the massive data centers that these two examples use just isn't feasible for our goals here ofc. Avoiding the botnet is a highly fundamental priority for /robowaifu/.

>that when not even being prompted did things like...
Yes, good examples of social spontaneity that we should all strive for in fashioning our robowaifu's personalities. There are whole books that could literally be written about this single topic.

>Even if I know it's fake, it's about as real as any interaction a girl can give me so why not indulge it anyway?
Exactly. Even knowing you have just a simulacrum always there to support you (as an actual healthy idealization of what women fell from) would be of tremendous psychological benefit to most men in the world. Knowing you could come home to a great waifu (instead of some self-centered, grasping harpy) and relax after a hard day would be a dream.
> pic related

>Real idea guy stuff I know.
Haha, every great idea starts out as, well, an ''idea''. We thrive on it here tbh. :^)

Please make yourself at home, and have a look around. Who knows, maybe you'll find something you want to work on here?

# 98
>>5157
I'm not needing a turing testable waifu. I wouldn't want to limit anyone's ambitions but I'm not looking to code sentient A.I. Not that it's not a noble endavor and I would definitly encourage the work be done by those who can do it but that's not within the scope of my vision.

For a frame of reference, Nintendo can make villagers in animal crossing "come to life" with a relative handful of lines and occasional instances of them referring to things you've said or did in the past. That's with them having many villagers with their own personalities and so on. I imagine if I could focus down on one character and flush out her dialogue tree you could get some pretty decent conversations with a mixture of simple A.I. tricks to have your bot bring up things you've mentioned. Concievably, you could even augment the inflection of some lines or the frequency in which certain lines are used to impart certain personalities or moods. I wouldn't be breaking new ground in any respect I don't think, instead just taking existing tech and seeing what what happens when push things to limit.  A lot of the tools that I would need already exist, it's just a matter of assembling them in such a way that I breathe life into the program.

My biggest issue I think would be having the bot integrate data it collects from weather broadcasts, news, or previous conversations and seemlesly weaving it into her dialogue tree without making it clunky. 

>>5158
>I didn't know about him. Smart & creative man.
He certainly was. The tech that brought the original GB to life wasn't anything ground breaking in its day. You had full color handhelds like the Sega Game Gear and the Atari Lynx which also used currently existing tech at the time, but it was poorly implemented. In the end, the little handheld that could with a simple monochrome screen was smashing sales records while the SGG and AL chewed through batteries too fast and was too expensive.

Lateral innovation. Take what already works, and polish it up. Make it the best that it can be and see what you can get.

>Participating along with us in our C++ learning thread would be a good choice
perhaps. I do a few things on /monster/ though so this would be a side project of a side project kind of deal. I'm much better at crafting dialogue and drawing than I am at any kind of coding. 

>social spontaneity
Simply saying "hello, how was work?" or "I've been waiting for you to get off work!" would be fine for me and I figure such interactions could be prompted by something as simple as a timestamp that gets averaged out based on when you say hello to it. Say you get off work at 8:00 and message your bot at 8:30 or around that time on a regular basis. If your phone/webcam detects your face that could generate the "I've been waiting!" type of response or something like that based on that average timestamp.  It doesn't need to know why its doing it I just need it to do it. The magic under the hood isn't important for me since the trick isn't anything spectacular. The coding itself  would be little more than a glorified alarm clock that sets its own time, but instead of the interaction being a loud beeping noise, I would have it produce dialogue trees based on certain conditions of the interaction. 
>Knowing you could come home to a great waifu (instead of some self-centered, grasping harpy) and relax after a hard day would be a dream.
Indeed. I would think with my project someone could probably take what I made and do something better. Maybe integrate the thing into VR or have it utilize more external data for additional dialoge.

You can think about what dialog and thinking skills your waifu should have, without needing to code. If you get some overview over what current chatbots, graph databases like RDF and neuronal networks can do, then you can at least have ideas, write them down and share them.

Hello /robowaifu/ I am the board owner of Leftcel on 9chan.
https://9chan.tw/leftcel/
http://ninechnjd5aaxfbcsszlbr4inp7qjsficep4hiffh4jbzovpt2ok3cad.onion/leftcel/
And our out of band gab channel is:
https://gab.com/Leftcel_Infilitrator

Leftcel is short for "Leftist Incels" which is a little tongue in cheek.  While some of use are definitely incels, I choose the name because anyone that criticizes feminism and women are instantly labeled incels, so I figured I might as well embrace the name.   
We are a Men's Right's, Incel, Anti-feminist community but from a left wing anti-capitalist perspective.  We talk about left wing subjects but also about things like how capitalism is impacting the male sex.
I created the site because every left wing online space banned critique of feminism and men's issues advocacy.  And the manosphere (term for the pro-male sub-culture on the internet) is all right wing politically, although that is slowly changing.
We think that cheap, widely available sex dolls will be a libratory tool that will empower men to control their libido, and give the ability to carefully choose a mate for a long term relationship, and when their parenthood beings.  Instead of now where men resist their natural and beautiful sex drive until they succumb to it with women and circumstances that they would not otherwise have tolerated.  It will give men control of their sexual appetite instead of being slaves to it, and strip the opposite sex of using it against them to control them.  Much in the same way birth control did for women in the 1960's.
I'm definitely trying to drive more traffic to the site, and the topics maybe valuable to anons here even if they are not interested in the left, since we often analyze current sexual politics.  The type of intelligence that sex doll makers like yourself can capitalize on.

Hi and welcome, but tbh I personally hope we can keep politics of any kind to a minimum here. If its directly about regulation of robowaifus its of course of everyone's interest. For things beyond that, groups which often don't get along with each other have their own platform(s) or spaces.

# 110

Oh yes, I agree.  I didn't mean to imply that I'd talk about politics on this board.  I was just inviting any anons that would like to read our analysis on sexual politics over on our board because it's relevant to what you are doing here.

Hello, /leftcel/ , welcome. Thanks for letting us know something about yourself. While we're not at all about leftist politics here--but rather about hard engineering work--we welcome different viewpoints ITT. 

Certainly what we're working towards here ultimately represents an existential threat to feminism and all the evils of anti-femininity most modern women have been duped into swallowing (and often simply for greedy corporate and other agendas). This obviously puts us squarely at odds with the common globohomo agendas out there. This is something we as a community here at /robowaifu/ are already well aware of 

>The type of intelligence that sex doll makers like yourself can capitalize on.
Heh, not to be ''too'' pedantic about it (and probably it's just semantic niggling anyway :^), but there's definitely a reason we're not named /sexdoll/. But stick around and you'll probably figure that out for yourself.

Yes I didn't. I basically like everything you guys do. As far ad it isn't degenerate.
>Mind telling us about your community Anon?
Yes, why not?
If I had to sum up /monster/ in one sentence it would be: Ultra-vanillafags who like monstergirls and are far-right. 
On /monster/, monsterfags usually just post pics of a monstergirl in a dedicated thread. But /monster/ also makes it's own content from art to writefaggotry and even cyoa. There are also other threads like a dreams and pantheon thread. I'm not the best one to talk too much but whatever.

# 117
>>5838
I was laughing the other day at how they're banning sex dolls in some countries and thinking about how people will end up creating monster girl robowaifus that don't fit the definition of the ban so that their robowaifu isn't illegal. It's too bad there aren't more from /monster/ interested in developing robowaifus. They're one of the few productive boards still around.

You know what, this is flattering. The picture is nice.  As for the greeting, the jab reminds me that even radical mgtows like Turd Flinging Monkey even had female fans. I'd say once waifu robodoll kits hit the market there will be a wider array of fans of dress-up like with current ball jointed dolls. 
It would even be a return to origins, as even Barbie was based on Bild Lilli, a doll meant for adult men.

# 129
I've posted on /robowaifu/ in the past to spitball potential ideas. I've been particularly interested in the speech synthesis. Recently, I was introduced to 15.ai and a game called Strip Poker Night at the Inventory (SPNATI). As most of you probably know, 15.ai is partially the result of the collective efforts of /mlp/ to create accurate speech synthesis of MLP characters. SPNATI is a hentai parody of Telltale's Poker Night at the Inventory. You can check it out at spnati.net. 

I got the idea the idea to combine these two things, and webm related is a demonstration of what I think is possible. A fully AI voiced hentai game. You could call it "Pony Strip Poker Night at the Inventory," but I dream of also including other characters, not just the MLP ones.

However, there are a few obvious problems:
There are many lines of dialogue. A character could have well over 1000 lines. This number can reduced, as there are a lot of lines for specific interactions with other characters. I spent about 40 minutes to produce the 32 lines used in the webm. That includes the time for me to type in a line, process it, listen to it, tweak the parameters a bit, and then repeat until I got a decent result. It is not practical for me to process thousands of lines of dialogue across multiple characters. Hypothetically, the process could be automated, but without someone checking the output voice line, the quality would most likely suffer. If 30 or so anons were willing to contribute that much time, then I think one character could be fully voiced in a reasonable time frame. The trouble is that I am unprepared to organize a large scale project like this, and I have no idea if there would be enough interested anons who are willing to contribute.

I'd like to reach out across the webring and figure out how many anons would possibly be interested in working on this. I also would need help organizing the project. I have experience coding, so I should be able to handle the modification of SPNATI to play audio files. But the bulk of the work would require many people contributing voice lines and then organizing those lines into a completed product.

Even if it doesn't take off, I think this is a very intriguing example of how speech synthesis technology could be applied to H-games.

# 130
>>8113
Thanks for letting us know about your project work Anon. It's definitely an on-topic sort of effort for this board.

# 131
I'd like to help you anon! Those are some awesome synthetic voices, so the more lines available for them the better.
I don't have much coding exp outside of programming servos in Arduino and some basic Python though...and that was all on Windows 10. However, I am determined when it comes to advancing robowaifus. I have written lines for my own robot...although I only watched the first couple of series of MLP back when it first came out, and I'm not really a "brony"...so I don't know how much help I could be?

# 132
>>8116
I probably should have posted this link earlier. 
Here's the relevant Google doc for the Pony Preservation Project from /mlp/.
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xe1Clvdg6EFFDtIkkFwT-NPLRDPvkV4G675SUKjxVRU/edit#
This document is full of useful information, so feel free to peruse it.
I used Deltavox RS to generate the audio in the .webm, and it's fairly straightforward to use. You don't need any coding knowledge at all. There's a user guide in the Google doc as well as a download link. You can try experimenting with some different input lines and parameters. 

I'm not really a brony either, but it's my hope that this proof of concept will encourage anons to work on similar projects with other characters.

# 133
>>8118
Thanks! BTW, any chance you could post the file(s) somewhere like catbox? If you wouldn't mind that would be a big help to us?

# 134
>>8118
Very cool, anon! Thank you. Gonna get hold of some MLP episodes and follow the tutorials. This project will be useful for anyone wanting to learn how to make their own synthetic voices instead of just relying on commercially available ones! A fundamentally important robowaifu building block!

# 135
>>8123
No need, there's already a mega link for Deltavox RS in the Google doc I posted:
https://mega.nz/file/CMBkzTpb#LDjrwHbK0YiKTz0YllofVuWg-De9wrmzXVwIn0EBiII
It has everything you need. Start it up load the model, pick a character and an emotion, and you're good to go.
There's more information in the guide:
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1z9V4cDvatcA0gYcDacL5Bg-9nwdyV1vD5nsByL_a1wk/edit

>>8128
Just by the way, you won't need to worry about collecting any audio or training any models; all that has already been done. If you're planning on listening to the characters so that you can familiarize yourself with their natural speaking voice, then by all means go ahead.

# 136
>>8129
Oh, now I get it! I was just looking at the old contributions spreadsheet for each episode and it looked like everything had already been labelled and transcribed up to season 9. Amazing amount of work has gone into the creation of these voices. This should be in the media or something to get it more recognition!

# 137


# 138

I see what you mean about having to play about with the pronunciations a bit, but I often have to do that with Sophie for certain words and phrases so not unexpected. I was blown away by how these voices can show different emotions convincingly.

I am looking into writing lines for characters in the game...but on the SPNATI website it says "Unfortunately, the audio files needed for music and voice acting would take up even more of SPNatI's limited space than the sprites do. Since the game is silent..."

I am confused if the devs will allow this? Even so, just learning about 15.ai has increased my motivation. The guys over at /mlp/ have created an incredible range of voices here!

# 143
>>8140
Would you prefer to keep this discussion in the speech synthesis thread, or would it be appropriate for its own thread? I only made the first post here because I felt that it's more of an /hgg/ topic than a /robowaifu/ one.

>>8142
Given the sheer number of characters in SPNATI, it would be very impractical to voice each of them. However, the intention of this project is to specifically exclude all characters other than the 4 MLP characters. That will dramatically reduce the storage needed. The audio data itself should be manageable. I've estimated that, using .mp3, the total file size should be well below 300MB.

The devs have licensed the project under the MIT license, so it will be perfectly acceptable for me to create a fork of the project and change it as much as needed.

# 144
>>8149
>Would you prefer to keep this discussion in the speech synthesis thread, or would it be appropriate for its own thread?
For now, I'd say keep it in the speech synthesis thread. If it gains a lot of traction here then we could consider otherwise later. Also, I'd gently point out to you that we are a SFW engineering board so please keep that in mind, thanks.

# 145
I've been lurking for a while here and I have to say that I really like what's going on! There's a really dedicated community as well as some very talented people involved in a project of this scope.
Found this place via /g/ about a year ago but recently came back to it from my bookmark folder about a month ago. Seems like some significant progress has been made despite Corona's best efforts and it's looking really promising.

This might be an absolutely awful idea, but I was thinking of attempting to start a "Counter Embassy" over on 4/g/. ( /rwg/? Maybe merge with /csg/? )
Whether this is a good idea given the current state of halfchan right now is up for debate; Shills are prominent, plenty of election tourists migrating to the hobby boards, and a few boards are borderline unusable even on a good day. It could either bring an influx of new blood which might be good for the creative process or it could bring bad publicity and people looking to cause this project harm. Just some thoughts from an interested engineer who would love to see this project succeed.

# 146

>Found this place via /g/ about a year ago
Welcome 4/g/, thanks for the encouragement and for sharing something about yourself with us here. Interestingly I began /robowaifu/ after a few ongoing threads with other anons there on your home turf. These took place probably 6 years or so ago now. So yeah, nice to see you here with us. I think we're quite likely to see our first basic home-grown robowaifu systems coming from here by this year's end, maybe even by our birthday celebration.

>It could either bring an influx of new blood which might be good for the creative process or it could bring bad publicity and people looking to cause this project harm.
Honestly, we've already been prepping for onslaughts when they occur -- both good ones and bad ones -- and have a few backups in place if worse ever came to worst. So, go ahead and share the board as you see fit. I think we'll be good to go.

> Do you have any scientific background?
Well, I guess this is the ''Embassy Thread'' after all, heh. I'm very interested in science in general, and I'm a software engineer (though self-taught). I've had an interest in creating an 'AI Friend' since as long as I can remember -- at least by first or second grade at school. That desire turned out to be a big part of equipping me to fill the role of founding this board. It seemed like ''it just had to happen'', no question. I'm sure others might have served just as well, I just happened to be the one.

Welcome /mlp/. Interesting project, good luck with it. There have been a few ponies visiting our board from time to time, as can be seen ITT. Is that '''4'''/mlp/ , BTW?

There has been some interesting work by some of the pony anons regarding synthesizing the VA voices (>>1563, >>8113, >>8118), ostensibly to 'preserve' them. It's actually been a rather sophisticated effort IMO, and evidences some of the benefits of fan dedication.

# 151
>>10984
Thanks, and yes I'm from the 4chan board >>>/mlp/. I've done zero work on the voices, but I figured a physical platform like this could use the excellent voices and the beginnings of a chatbot made by other anons. I've posted on the actuator thread here for over 6 months now. My plan is to make a 12 inch plushie bot, then 36-50 inch plushie bot, then something similar to Spot the robot dog, and then a plane-pony (plony) for the lols and to increase my powerlevel. I'd recommend another anon to corner the likely lucrative furry or FNAF robot market, which I cannot stomach. It's really incredible what autism can create.

so here is my regurgitation shit pile thought
. AI first module is for start up. on start up, creates a seperate drive/file, it creates a randomized labrynth matrix architecture within the computer. stage two, self learning activates. this is where the ai has restricted building abilities butit builds more ordered eldritch architecture 
. . you give it a folder full of stuff you want it to hot box echo chamber. or not. you could also just have a folder of all basic stuff and scatter in the environment (btw this will likely be a virtual machine sorta thing) ai then learns, spl.its, wages war, evolves. then we get to watch the progress and th end result. we could even have a turn off point measure to stop it getting too powerful

# 156

It's not about the money, but skills and effort. No one can guarantee you that something good would come out of it or how long it would take or what it would cost. Of course if I had some millions to spent I could hire some people and give it a try...

# 157
>>11234
Hello Anon, welcome. As the anon pointed out to you, there really are no guarantees about devising a quality AI system. There are example chatbot AIs like GPT-3 that took many millions and years to create. There are also stringent hardware requirements for that statistical approach as well.

So, making wild presumptions on both the meaning of the word 'AI' and our progress as a race on this truly frontier area, I'd guess roughly US$ 20-50 Bln, and maybe 20-25 years from now?

Have a look around the board while you're at it, there's lots of discussion on this topic in general here.

# 158
>>11241
even GPT-3 is just a fancy way to link database string entries am I wrong? is anything even "thinking" in such a scenario or is it like someone talking in their sleep? 
Has anyone yet tried to combine this chat "function" (which would be only part, or one "function", [imitating human chattiness] of a true AI consciousness) with persistent memory, ego emulation, visual processing, and the laundry list of what would actually be necessary for an autonomous being which could pass for self-aware? Replika AI tries this but it feels like emulation with a few simple "factoids" it stores about you. 
tl;dr anons dont want to fall in love with a database, anons want to talk to something that processing their information and perhaps even forms a model of them in its "mind"

# 159
>>11241
>I'd guess roughly US$ 20-50 Bln, and maybe 20-25 years from now?
Lol, that's not very optimistic. What are we even doing here, then?!? Within the next 5-7 years we are going to have something decent, and it will show before that. Just not with unnecessary requirements like "It has to be trained from the scratch, no other programs" ... "It needs to be a black box with a will of it's own" ...

>>11242
I don't know how much is has been combined with something else, they might not make that public. OpenCog might have.

# 161
>>11242

haha I love the ending on that sentence. I think high quality is relative if you checkout my thread, the 4 model is what people prefer
>>11242
I think maybe that's what you want but most people lean towards the simpler 2010's chat bot technology. I think as conversational ability degrades we will converge to AGI because people will be simpler than AI's in the current form.

# 162
>>11242
I certainly can't claim any expertise on the topic Anon, but as I understand it, the transformer simply uses a statistical probability model constructed during it's training phase to make a weighted prediction of suitable following text regarding input strings. This is why it works from an initial 'seed' &tc. And no, it most definitely isn't 'thinking' in any human sense. I'm personally skeptical that will ''ever'' happen, quite frankly.

>anons dont want to fall in love with a database...
Heh, very well-put Anon. I think we'll get there eventually with suitably satisfying simulacrums, just be patient.

>>11243
>Lol, that's not very optimistic
Fair enough Anon. :^) My estimate is on what we would roughly call an ''AGI'' today, and on second thoughts, I suspect my cost estimates are at least an order of magnitude __low__.

>Within the next 5-7 years we are going to have something decent,
I think you are correct Anon. Certainly something well-enough suited for a 'starter robowaifu' if you will.

>>11299
>I think as conversational ability degrades we will converge to AGI because people will be simpler than AI's in the current form.
LOL. I think just the opposite Anon, though I'm well aware of both the dynamics you're implying. Humans are profoundly capable and multifaceted. By far the most spectacular of all the natural creatures!

>what we would roughly call an AGI today,

I'm confident that within that timeframe it would be possible to get something close to a human in many if not most cases, within a household. There might be cognitive gaps, where the system fails and can't kearn the right pattern, but I don't see why fixing and polishing this would cost billions or trillions or being impossible. Having that said, best way to find out is not to waste time and get to work. Thinking about this, at least got me back to learning and working on it. Five years will pass way too fast.
