Here we have Maslow's hiearchy of needs. A psychological theory that basically breaks down what a man needs and what he can seek out in life. This seems like a good framework to identify what niche your robowaifu can address in her function, and how exactly to accomplish that. I think the third tier up is what most of us seek from a robowaifu. No matter how inert your robowaifu is in function, even motionless plastic can give you a sense of connection if you project a personality onto it. What do you think? Does Maslow's hierarchy of needs as a theory relate to you and your projects? Is there anything to this at all?

Yes, I think it's pertinent Anon. I'll have to take some time to think about it before I can give you a salient answer, but yes, it's a good thread topic.

I'd say robo-waifus could fill Esteem as well as Love and Belonging. Although I'd prefer ever man aim for self-validation, occasionally it's nice having external validation. A robo-waifu could provide that to some extent. 

What I find interesting in because my waifu is slim and athletic, I also aim to stay healthy and fit myself. Not just for better mental and physical health, but also to match my waifu/future waifbot XD

I believe the structure of the hierarchy suggests that building on the lower tiers is itself the path to the top. So yes, ideally this would all lead to self-actualization.

I thought the discussion was just about which part of the hierarchy robo-waifus fulfill. But yeah, the structure must be done from bottom, so unless you have the lowest two sections, robo-waifus won't be of much use.

The idea is that you could potentially build a robowaifu to fulfill any part of that hierarchy. Like for the physiological needs, a robowaifu that can help you keep track of your day-to-day health.
