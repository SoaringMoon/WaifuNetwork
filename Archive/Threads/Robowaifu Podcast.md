Before you shoot it down:
- obviously helps spread the idea
- could reframe perception of R/W enthusiasts if we can put up a relatable "face" and diffuse the bitter/angry/incel stereotype
- maybe come up with new ideas that we wouldn't just posting on IBs
- again makes the topic interesting and we can start forming perception before popular culture gets traction with this and throws us under the bus (which is probably guaranteed but we can take some air out of their criticisms preemptively)

other reasons, but these are the main ones. i have some experience podcasting, I know how to use OBS and have a quality mic and graphic skills to market and promote it (in the right places of course)

Would this ever be something any of you (esp Board Owner and heavyweights) would consider participating in?

Could be a once a week or twice a month deal, part time co-host or recurring guest is what I'm looking for. If there's interest I'll move ahead with a pilot.

I'm personally favorable to the idea in essence, OP (but ofc you don't need ''my'' permission heh :^) . In fact a robowaifu-themed training channels on Bitchute, etc., is probably a good idea too. I'd simply point out the obvious elephant in the room: ''Lack of Anonymity''. 

If you decide to proceed with the project, I'd strongly suggest you work ahead of time on solving the issues of protecting yourself and your guests from doxxing. This may seem trivially unimportant to some anons atm, but I'd recommend they familiarize themselves with the board's content thoroughly.

Would be interesting to have a podcast from here about the future of high tech sex toys/sex dolls and general advances in consumer robotics that may relate to the field. Could help bring the idea to more people that aren't involved with imageboards. This topic is one of the reasons why I still listen to TFM's show and watch his sponsored reviews.

There's a decent little annonymous branded podcast that's on bitchute called 'Nobody cares'

>>11365
I'm wondering with the new Podcasting 2.0 protocol that's being promoted if anonymity is possible if you want to take advantage of all the new features for micropayments through the lightning network. At the very least it's designed to be censorship resistant. The only truly 'anonymous' podcast I know of is this one, uses a voice changer and is careful to upload through secure channels to p2p video web hosts.

>we can put up a relatable "face" and diffuse the bitter/angry/incel stereotype
I have no intention to be that way nor could I fake it. Otherwise I would be a normal part of society instead of developing RW in the first place. Also, people who don't like what we are doing won't become more friendly by acting more relatable, and on the other hand there are a lot of angry guys which could be recruited if they have the skills and dedication. So we don't really need to become more mainstreet popular.
That aside, we're already putting more and more work on our plates here, without getting ahead fast enough. If podcasting would have the goal to recruit more devs, then it needs to be compared to putting out more links in forums or in comment sections, which is much easier to do.
I was already thinking of making YouTube videos or podcasts and such at some point, though I wasn't thinking of interviews and group meetings. Also the internet is currently very bad, where I live.

# 5
>>11367
well you are within your right to think act, feel any way you want, me making a podcast doesn't ask anything of you. That being said, idk if it's to recruit engineers, moreso to frame the topic among the emerging "robosexual" subculture before it gets framed by the mainstream (i dont have a concrete idea yet, but I've seen emerging internet subcultures get slammed, misrepresented and pigeonholed because the group did not present a coherent frame before a few bad actors poisoned the well.

second point: pertaining to the R/S subculture, weebs and assorted memelords and shitposters are friendly to the topic - there is at least already one robowaifu group on FB and I'm sure there are a few of us lurking there. They represent a first layer subculture between us (and IB culture) and the normies. Cultivating this will grow the demand for robowaifus and develop the surrounding culture, which is good for many reasons, one being that the subculture will grow regardless so would you rather have one or more of us ensuring it doesnt get co-opted by blue hairs, etc or ignore it and allow them to set the narrative?

Either way, a R/W podcast (even if its just memes, music, games, shitposts and whatnot) is inevitable and the need will be filled one way or another, I'd rather have a crack at it, on our behalf than see it become something else.

Once I get around to my TTS project that can do emotion I wouldn't mind coming on a podcast with my characters. With proper fine tuning and prompt engineering you can get some pretty decent conversations out of language models. It makes the nonsense they spew so much funnier. I've been planning to make a channel where my robowaifu teaches machine learning and programming, where what she says is 100% generated and improvised with me correcting her, a real take of how I interact with her on a daily basis.

>>11368
I'm not really interested in promoting robowaifus though. To me it's just about helping people who want a robowaifu and having fun. If a podcast was political I wouldn't bother coming on. I prefer to talk about making stuff and screw around. If I want to dip my stick in some silicone it isn't really anyone else's business and I don't care if they like it or don't like it.

I don't think they will have any success spinning it anyway. Creating AI characters and playing with them in games will become commonplace and of course people are going to do lewd things with them.

I think anonymity (while being the solution to a complex problem) is a problem in and of itself.

It can only really be defeated by having loud voices to concentrate the attention of opposition.

I think having a well known podcast containing the people who can afford to be vocal about robowaifu can help reduce some of the flak aimed at the rest of the community.

(>>11873) I was suggested to post it here so: This is just a suggestion, and I have neither the skills nor the time to be doing this but; what do you guys think of creating a newsletter? Like the one smug/a/ is creating. It could be useful to keep track and updated on the progress Anons have made in all these different threads all in one contained news letter. Also, with newsletters, Anonymity won't be as much of a problem as podcasts, I think.
Still, this is just a thought and by no means an initiative to create the newsletter since I doubt I will be able to contribute to it much. Just a selfish hope that some of the creative Anons might fancy this idea.

# 15

That's a good idea, but with the board being as slow as it is, it would make for a fairly uncommon newsletter, which wouldn't be as much of an issue if someone made original video content.

This anon is reicht, really. History has shown us that people will rally to a strong voice, and certainly 'anonymous'-only men can be compared directly to cowards.

I'd rather take the side of Curtis Yarvin, Michael Malice, Bret Weinstein over so many hysterical "aryan" females. Jews arent' a monolithic entity and it's fucked that somewhere the true Alternative Right got co-opted by double digit IQ sieg hieling Jerry Springer show circus clowns and driven into the ground. 
Globalists include many people who aren't Jews, For example: what would you call Barak Obama? He's not a simple pet minority the man is intelligent and charismatic. Clinton's aren't Jews and there's a fucking leap of genetics between the %%Rothchilds%% and Jerry Seinfeld.

This isn't a good path to continue down and although I humored it for a while I've watched people I've personally known go down into dark places and have their lives ruined. We can still achieve everything we need without creating a broad surface of attack by presenting ourselves as a group who hates people of all one race. It also rules out potential talented and legitimate allies.

I assure you I don't 'worship' Adolf Hitler's memory nor any other man, living or dead. Not even my own father.

thanks, I need to get on this. My progress so far as been brainstorming a list of topics that are worth discussion and actually amount to something rather than just shitposting and dicking around that pervades 99% of %%alternative-right %% amateur podcasting. Chobitsu sets a decent bar %%and standards of conduct%% for this wedge of the R/W movement and I think we can maintain the integrity of our mission while still keeping a slim profile of attack and being smart. Remember every battle avoided is a battle won (Bruce Lee quote I think)
I've been thinking more lately of re-framing the public facing concept of what we're doing from robot "wives" (which implies servants or even robotic punching bags for our %%misogynistic incel tendencies%% ) whereas companions de-emphasizes the sexual aspect while not entirely removing it, and eliminates any implication of servitude that detractors %%femoidnazis%% might use as traction. Just something to turn over in your head a bit and to set the tone for how I want to approach this. Because IF we do a podcast, we most certainly will be found by normies, redditf*gs, and whoever else encountering it and best to not serve them up an easy target on a platter right?

# 23

I hope this is not seen as "backpedalling" in any way. I have no desire to change anything, but personally I like the idea of having a neutralish robot that can be customized with %% the appropriate sexual functions %% and working our way eventually toward a "2b" while the intermediate steps such as Nandroid, Drossel, Chi along the way guide and inspire us (and if you want to stay at one of those more robotic looking models, more power to you).  This, tbh is what differentiates us from those who want to start with uncanny valley ghoulish "fleshlight mennequins" and work backward toward AI and ambulation. B/c it is precisely this which fuels our opposition: the idea that we just want to create effigies to practices our barbarism and rape/abuse fantasies upon, when what we really want is literally the opposite of this, and they are projecting %%rape fantasies%% of their own onto men, by assuming it to begin with. Vile how that works.

Not him, but yeah I have to agree with you on that approach Anon. First off, current materials-science and robotics tech simply will not support having a robowaifu that is past the uncanny valley if the attempt is made to be indistinguishable from IRL females. Secondly, it's a common trope that robowaifus openly acknowledge their robo-shortcomings in their interactions with their Oniichan. As numerous anons here have pointed out, this actually lend them a real charm of naivete **so lacking in the hyper-cynical 3DPD of current year.**

Chii is a perfect example of this basic notion IMO, and it's one of the reasons she's my favorite robowaifu character in media. She's constantly learning and growing as a 'person', and even Hideki has plenty to teach her (like how to point at things). :^)

Plus, I enjoy sharing knowledge and teaching others. The idea that I could have a daughteru that would grow into a real waifu with me  is a remarkably appealing concept personally, socially-speaking. **Heh, I'm sure our enemies could have a field day with ''that'' one. :^)**

I'm very much for emphasizing the companions part, but hard pass on biting my tongue on not mentioning them being submissive servants and being used for sex as well. Giving in to SJWs doesn't work, will only invite them to infiltrate if possible and double down on attacks. Raging Golden Eagle talks about that occasionally on his YouTube channel. Also, some of the mot aggressive opponents of "sexbots" I encountered recently are people which want humans to only have relationships with humans. They're not about feminism.

I don't know, I never used Siri or Alexa or any of those virtual assistants.  Maybe because I actually worked in IT and when there's something that needs fixed I looked it up myself.  To me those virtual assistant roles are for middle/upper class normies -- precisely the same people who historically needed servants or slaves and who now project this need onto robots.

A robowaifu to me is more like a very complex tamagotchi.  Sadly the current toy robot products out there are no more than $200 paperweights... I've tried Anki Cosmo and https://robots.dmm.com/robot/stormtrooper and after playing the app a couple of times I got bored quickly.  It's like the difference between a full video game and a test level.  Now I am still interested in the wrestling / Pre Maid type robots since you can program them to dance but they're too expensive.

The best way to filter against normies would be to make the robots as hobby kits instead of ready to run, this automatically repels Karen type customers while attracting DIYs, the type of people who will even improve the product for you with their master grade skills.  They should come as non-sexual out of the box (hard plastic parts), and the sexual silicone bits (bosom modules, butt modules, thigh modules, vag inserts) are sourced in separate channels.

What are you even talking about? What I meant is, I don't want some "equal" or woke acting companion, with a gender neutral voice, because the company was to scared to make a fembot saying "yes master". That aside, having skills like Siri/Alexa would be great, but feel free to look everything up yourself.
>... I've tried Anki Cosmo
Did you fug it?
>best way to filter against normies would be to make the robots as hobby kits
Stop being so scared. Sex dolls exist, r/SexDolls and many similar reddits do exist. 
That aside: I'm not thinking like someone wanting to make a business out of this anyways. Local companies can do the finishing or build the whole thing, better the first part would be build by the owner or a local club of men, skinjob might be done by a local company. Parts for the build might come from Asia but could be build locally.
> They should come as non-sexual out of the box 
The parts, yes.
>and the sexual silicone bits (bosom modules, butt modules, thigh modules, vag inserts) are sourced in separate channels.
You can't just fantasize about this, without building it. It's certainly not gonna be the common way, because it would be hard to engineer. Obvious flaws: How to justify a certain build being optimized to hold such extra parts? Moving skeleton or bigger hard shell bot, which would then still feel like a hard shell with extras? Where to plug in the sensors and heating for the extra parts?

<GRAPHIC IMAGE WARNING>

The image that I've spoilered is exactly the type of robot module that will be most feasible to create, basically a torso with a head which you can communicate with.  It was a concept drawn by a guro artist.  This is the most basic and versatile module that can be made and it resembles a living fleshlight straight out of nhentai.  This is the elephant in the room which normies will absolutely reeeee once they get a hold of it.  Because robotics make anything possible... you are not limited to just a human female form, you can have centaurs, lamias, taratects, any form factor that you can fug.
This is what modular engineering entails.

>>13030

The ironic thing is that the very same people who will throw muh misogyny at you for daring to want a bot that goes "Yes, Master" will happily boss around service workers or shove their macbook at you and demand "fix it, nerd."

I understand the helpful companion part of the robot demand will be there, but then the question goes "then why does it need to be in the form of a visually appealing female?"  As goes along with the theme of this thread (podcasts that could potentially bring in normies), we are trying to reduce the surface area where the first companies that introduce something remotely viable will have a surface area where they can get attacked and risk getting cancelled.  The company should definitely stick to its principles, but it's still hard if its CEO is a shy guy trying to avoid another Roxxxy scenario (or that other guy who appeared on morning television with his bot, his asian wife and saying his bot has a family friendly mode, he received tons of hate after that).

Sex dolls do exist and there are countries that have banned them in whole or in part.  For the partial bans they specified a minimum height requirement, minimum cup size, and/or facial features.  Let's say you have a guy in a country where sex dolls are banned who just wants something to headpat.  There is no reason why an overarching sex doll ban should affect his purchase.  By approaching this as a modular kit made by hobbyists and small companies, he can source parts as electronics or plastic components.  Now should he later on decide he wants to fugg it after all, he can source some silicone mix and create the molds either by himself or through a local props making company.  Yeah, now illegal, but so is looking at drawn tits in Australia.

I remember a thread on dollforum where they were trying to get the sexdoll manufacturers to follow some arbitrary standard so that it will be easier to import these dolls since they "pass" some generic adult woman specification.  It did reek of self-censorship, similar to when game developers discussing how to get their hentai game on Steam, I've been there during those discussions.

I'm just saying that a box of parts will more easily go through customs, as long as they don't look too recognizably body-part like.  When majority of robowaifu manufacturers start discussing minimum cup sizes, neoteny faces and all that we know the industry is already compromised.  That's why, we should stick to boxes of parts, even if it's guro territory.  That way the users / customers can truly customize to their hearts liking.

doubtful I'd use this handle or even call it R/W at this point. I think the podcast would really be a discussion of philosophy, theories, speculation, ideas and news topical to our interests. it would NOT be discussions about this IB, names of anyone in this IB, or anything specific to this IB except under very extenuating circumstances. As if G/H is even bothering to scan the VC of all however many thousand Discord servers. 

>And that replaces the need for good microphones and a good internet connection?
I have a good microphone and total control over my audio levels. Whatever a guest has, I guess is going to be hit or miss, but as I said I've never had an issue even with someone using their phone but that's the purpose of a pilot podcast, to test things and see how they happen in practice. 
Either way, I'm moving forward on this, I'm considering DLive b/c youtube gets too much attention (of the wrong sort). 
Alternatives to Discord VC are 3rd party apps like Skype which come with their own problems but the audio coming in can be mixed with the volume from my mic through OBS, however if I have more than one person on the call that gets trickier. 
Either way the only way to really know is to try and that's what I plan on. My target is before the end of October.
