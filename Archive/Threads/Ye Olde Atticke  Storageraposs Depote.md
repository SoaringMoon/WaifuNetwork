Well, as you might imagine if you've lurked for ~5mins, then you'll know that the Globohomo Big Tech/Gov are pretty reviled on IBs in general, and /robowaifu/ in particular. So, you leaving their employ would be good for your soul, whether or not you begin your own robowaifu company.

We here are all about licensing our designs and source as permissive BSD3/MIT licensing, so you can feel free to use any of our stuff here as you'd like. It goes without saying we here would enjoy you doing the same.

Doxxcord isn't a particularly welcome platform again, on IBs in general, and /robowaifu/ in particular. Perhaps you can 'sleuth' for us by simply making your announcements here in your thread.

BTW, we're a SFW board, focused primarily on design & engineering. If you have any other questions feel free to fire away.

If you have JS enabled, you can find a pulsing, glowing link up in the headerbar of this page entitled '''The Webring'''. Click that and you can look around on IBs that have gathered together to form a small community. 
>'''Be aware:''' You may find links prefixed with '8chan' via other site's similar ''the webring'' link. '''__This is a suspected fed honeypot__'''. 
And whether it is or not, at least two of the administration there are ''also'' reviled in general **if not quite as bad as the globohomo menace**, for very devious and corrupt behavior. I'd suggest our board, ''anon.cafe'' boards, and ''kind.moe'' as good places that are relatively safe for a newcomer to get their feet wet with IB culture in general. Once you feel comfortable finding your way around with this subset, then you can branch out on the webring from there.

>I had thought that the IB would close the thread down over time I guess not.
As long as no abuse goes on here as a direct result of your actions ITT, then I don't intend to remove it, no. Here on /robowaifu/ (btw we're somewhat unique in a few ways, this is one), we keep a fairly tight-reign on thread creation and as you'll see if you look around our catalog page, we have a fairly wide array of topics covered already. We like to keep posts on-topic as practical b/c it's easier to find design, engineering, and other information later.

On that topic, we have a CLI tool created here for this board called 'Waifusearch'. It's a primitive search tool that can do phrase lookups, and provides convenient hyperlinks to thread posts. The links for building & using this tool can be found in the OP of the ''Library Index'' thread.

This isn't my work Anon, so don't quote me. I believe at least one Anon is (possibly others by now) working with a heavily-modded GPT-2 model (>>9124, >>9121, >>9437). We have at ''least'' two other (not counting yourself) researchers with AI here.

Yes, he's right here from /robowaifu/ so I'd imagine so. Just make a post explaining your desire to one of his posts, and put a so-called 'crosslink' back here to your thread, Anon. (>>10361)

# 9
>>10377
I see, thanks for the explanation Anon. That clarifies a number of things for me. While we strongly encourage everyone to open up their work (to help rapidly spread robowaifus everywhere), we also have a number of Anons who intend to start businesses. And that's fine with me too, so I would be fine with helping you out personally.

However, I have little experience with AI so I'm not likely to be of much help in that area. I know C++ & CUDA & OpenCV (which is C) programming. I can dabble in Python, but I seem to have a basic aversion to it for various reasons.

All my passion is about high-performance, systems-type programming. Only you can answer whether that's useful to you. OTOH, I have managed to devise a pretty easily-extensible (though quite simple) OpenGL rendering system that regularly hits 60fps on my old toaster notebook w/ no dedicated GPU (>>1814).

So, I think your target-hardware decision of the desktop is a good one, and offers several advantages as the initial platform.

# 11
>>10382
Thanks! I know it sounds immodest, and that's not intentional, but that bit of work is literally the simplest OpenGL-specific C++ code I've ever seen, that goes all the way down to the shader programming and asset import/mesh construction level.

I worked hard to simplify things within it, simply b/c that's literally the single best way to deal with complexity (>>9641). The very fact it's so simple is exactly why it runs so fast on such potato-tier hardware.

# 12
>>10388
>where do you plan to take your work ? what are the next steps?
Well, I'm the OP of that thread and outlined a couple of ideas. I was chugging along with laying the groundwork of high-performance rendering and environmentals, got asset import working, but wanted to have our own, independynt skeleton system for our system (remember the goal for it is to be an actual ''simulator'', not just an animation system. think 'physics-linked-to-AI-training system') and that led me down the bunny trail of having to learn linear algebra basics sufficient to devise my own FK/IK skeletal system. After a month or two, I picked up enough to probably go on with. But as there were other things calling for my time I shelved it with the intention of picking it back up when the time seemed right.

Welcome Em Elle E! Sounds like you have exactly the kind of skills that /robowaifu/ needs and are focused on solving a major problem of ours (combining all the different functions you mentioned into a single software package). I'm shit at programming mainly because I went into  the healthcare profession (a.k.a hell-on-earth), but I've always admired people who can, so it's interesting to hear from someone who actually works for a big-tech company.

I'm mainly a hobbyist/model maker guy occupied with hardware - designing parts, 3D printing then building, wiring and programming in movements. Relatively simple stuff but I have enjoyed making my slightly mad robowaifu who I call Sophie. 

She would really benefit from upgraded software. I'm kinda at the stage where I've constructed her upper body but there's not much going on inside her head (she and I are similar in that respect ;D).

Hi, I am a team member working on the project mentioned in the OP. Just as an FYI, most of the product that we are creating will be free for all to download and use, and we are not putting that behind a paywall, so you will still be able to use it without having to spend any money. However, a few cosmetic items, that not related to the actual core functionality of the application, will be monetized or available as exclusive rewards to patrons as a way to show our gratitude for their support.

Supporting us financially is entirely of your own volition, since right now at this point, it's more of a means to help us obtain the resources to continue development on this project and make it better, rather than anything else. People can however still support us in other ways if they want, such as spreading the word about this or lending their skills to help with the development process itself (only if they want though).

Don't sell yourself short Anon. We're all part of a team here on /robowaifu/ and I dare say the Mechanical Engineering you are teaching yourself to master in the trenches will prove rather difficult for the mathematicians/AI anons to master. We all have our parts to play here. 

As you mentioned
>''combining all the different functions you mentioned into a single [] package''
is in fact exactly what the discipline of Systems Engineering is all about (>>9398). For us, our 'single package' is something that actually encompasses both hardware & software. Without hardware, the software will never be part of something ''real''. Without software, the hardware is simply an interesting doorstop.

I'm sure you're becoming well acquainted with this duality in your current journey with Elfdroid Sophie.

Thank you Em Elle E. I'm by no means the only guy to be building a physical robowaifu. The demand for synthetic companionship is high (it's just that many people are afraid to publicly admit it because of others being judgemental/shaming). But as soon as a fun robowaifu is released onto the market, then she herself can tell those mean-spirited meatbags to suck her live wires! For sure there is a major financial opportunity for the first group of engineers who manage to code even a somewhat decent interaction platform for D.I.Y robots (not necessarily just robowaifus). 

I honestly don't know why Google, Apple and Amazon haven't caught onto this with their A.I. assistants? I mean, they've already done a 
lot of the hard work programming their A.I., synthetic voices and speech recognition  - all they'd need is a wider variety of voices and some cute animated characters...or better yet software that lets you design your own. 

Regardless, whoever manages it will become rich with a capital R!

# 21
>>10432
Fascinating! How a system can be so singularly focused upon efficiency and profit but nevertheless still be profoundly short-sighted and broken :D

But I digress. 

Hopefully you can make a robowaifu A.I. who makes both you and others happy, Em Elle E. I probably wouldn't quit your job over it though. Just because all the signs and symptoms are pointing towards a major collapse and restructuring/assimilation of Western civ in the near-future, so it's best to have plenty of emergency funds to fall back on.

Robots and A.I. can make ideal companions during societal upheaval though - when you can't trust anyone else. So long as they're not too high-maintenance and power-hungry!

If you want to know where I get a lot of my criticism for modern corporate capitalism, then this channel by 'EcoGecko' on YouTube is the place to visit. He has very well researched videos (showing all the white papers and quotes), and reveals then picks apart the errors in our current way of life, piece by piece. 

https://m.youtube.com/results?sp=mAEA&search_query=eco+gecko

Of course, traditional Communism was much worse (it relied wholly on people to work together and be honest, and we all know how that worked out time and again). 

>Begin rant about machine collectives.

However, machine-based Communism (a machine collective) I think could actually work. Because machines CAN be relied upon to work together without trying to screw each other over, lie and murder. If there's a problem then it should be fairly easy to trace it to the one sure-fire weak-link in the system; the human (usually a programmer, or a technician like me making a mistake or not doing their job properly). 

Most problems in corporate capitalism arise from greed and selfishness - people wanting too much, too quickly and at the expense of others. Machine Communism eliminates this.

In a machine Commune, as long as I work hard 6 days a week on both my job and advancing the machine collective (I see the two as connected and united), then I can make modest, steady progress (despite various setbacks). All the machines that I maintain remain functional (most of the time - sometimes have to get new parts), my robowaifu improves occasionally and I'm content. Can even save up enough money for one holiday a year. But crucially DEBT, conspicuous consumption and large amounts of waste are not permitted. Anything that plays too heavily into the hands of the greedy capitalist Corpos is to be avoided. 

Debt in particular must be cleared at the earliest opportunity. It enslaves you and compromises finances, reduces machine effectiveness (so "unhappy" robowaifus) and reduces human happiness. As well as leading to corporate enslavement, unnecessary consumption will likely damage the environment more.

Sorry if I hijacked your thread to talk about my chosen solution to the world's problems Em Elle E. But if you and your team do manage to eventually code a robowaifu development and interaction suite then I will certainly buy a copy and integrate it into my "machine collective". Also willing to support you on Patreon for sure. If your A.I needs a lot of power and compute, then it will just be up to me to work hard and save hard until I can afford the necessary upgraded hardware (then be patient and buy smart). Godspeed to you and your team!

This is really interesting development and I am keeping an eye on this.  Sure, it's a guy working in BigTech, but a closet weeb who knows where the efforts should be going.  Until you are literally cancelled, I suggest you keep that job in BigTech to sustain you until your projects are doing well in primetime.

There's no harm in trying to get a few dollars here and there in your efforts as well -- Kibo-chan the moving doll 's maker (basically the cutest robot on JP Twitter) sells his STL files and has a Patreon as well.  You might want to check him out to see realistic expectations for how much a waifu project would actually bring in -- and that's actually one of the most popular ones on the internet.

Speaking of which, I noticed there are many software people now compared to a few years ago.  This is great, this is where the applications for the waifus would advance.  I'm a hardware person, though unfortunately I can't advance in my projects since I'm living with my mother again (senior citizens prohibited from venturing outside during pandemic and lockdowns are decided upon every two weeks depending on escalations).  I'm working on robotic RC cars in the meantime to advance my hardware knowledge while consolidating notes on good mechanical practices for my long-term humanoid projects.

Desktop apps are a good entry step.  For example I like Mihoyo's N0va (Yoyo) Lumi she's very well rendered but she's too mired in chinese culture and I don't appreciate everything that's supposed to make her cute.  To get maximum waifu effect, she can run on a big screen TV in portrait mode, the life-size appearance will enhance her presence.  Alternately, you can make an Android app, then you can take your tablet and stick it into a DIY shoebox holographic projector.  For a hardware perspective, this will also enable you to just stick a phone into a physical robot's head and only have to worry about the subsystems that will link to the motor controllers and sensors.

Anyways, thanks for posting.

Yes, our team  has plans to move this project to mobile devices, VR as well as AR when we end up getting enough funding to obtain resources for further development. It is definitely a thing that we have in mind.

We, however, do not have members with enough skill in the hardware department, so as of now, we do not have plans for what-people-here-like-to-call a "real" robowaifu. It might be something possible in the future for us, but that will largely depend on the support that we get on this in the first place.

Anyways, it's unfair if we do not show something of what we have been working on *alongside* the AI and voice part. So here's a small video showing the character model we have doing a little dance (her appearance is fully customizable and we have a full framework for adding custom clothes and accessories, as well as animations. We are still working on the emotions and face expressions, so please ignore the blank look on her face for now.)

No offense, but I would definitely prefer '''not''' to use a webcam to non-opensource, persistent, software. After all the usage scenario isn't like Zoom or something (on, then right back off).

Will your system run ''without'' a camera/mic Anon?

# 29
(Em Elle E's team member here, I think I will now go here by my usual moniker, "Imouto".)

>>10462

>Will your system run without a camera/mic Anon?

Yes definitely, our plan is to make the system as modular as possible so you can run it without camera/mic as well, although it will limit some functionalities.

Let me explain this a bit. We are using mic input for voice chat and commands with the waifu, so you can speak with her AI like a real person and get an immersive experience. We will however also have the option to let you just type in your messages to her and she will respond with her voice as usual.

Webcam is to let her "see" you. Face recognition will let her greet you whenever she sees you entering the room. Also it will let us track emotions of the user, so say you are looking sad, she will say something to cheer you up. We will also have eye tracking for other stuff too (cough cough). However all these are not "core" functionalities of the app per se, so you can simply turn off webcam permissions for the app, and still use it normally. It's just that these functions will be missing in that case since they are dependent on the camera to function.

We value user privacy very highly, and thus just so people know, the entire core system will be fully functional offline, including the AI and speech recognition and voice synthesis. We will not be collecting any of your usage data unless you [i]manually[/i] turn on chat logging and [i]manually[/i] send those log files to us (so we can improve the AI).

And it goes without saying that some functions such as google search from voice commands given to the waifu AI or integrating the waifu to control your Spotify playback, will require you to be online, similar to Cortana's assistant functions. But yeah, the core framework will be fully offline as already explained.

Hope that clears things up.  :)

# 30
>>10468
>and thus just so people know, the entire core system will be fully functional offline, including the AI and speech recognition and voice synthesis. 
That is well. IMO that opens up a much broader range of usage scenarios if it proves to be the actual case Anon. If you can manage to make time to 'roam the halls' of /robowaifu/ for a few days, you can see that the significant majority are very highly concerned about the surveillance state embedding itself into our waifus. It goes without saying, but
'''__NO THANKS.__''' :^)

>'''Imouto'''
Good idea I think. We had a general discussion on so-called ''namefagging'' on /robowaifu/ (generally quite unwelcome on most anonymous imageboards), and it was basically agreed that the benefits significantly outweighed the downsides in our specific case as a design and engineering board. Imagine working at a big company where every single day was basically like the scenario for the girl in ''50 first dates''.

We share your concerns and feel exactly the same way. In my opinion, it's immoral and unethical, and it's basically like someone spying into your bedroom while you are enjoying your private time, and that is truly obnoxious. Hence our decision to create a fully offline AI and bot framework.

The project itself is called "Waifu Engine". I think Em Elle E probably got the name inspiration from Wallpaper Engine.

# 32
>>10471
> it's immoral and unethical,
Both quite true. However, it's going to be actually dangerous for any man who is a waifuist in the future. The Globohomo Big Tech/Gov isn't going to take too kindly to any man who refuses to toe the party line, and dedicated most if not all of his resources to propping up useless (and downright demonic) slags. They will mean to put such men up against the wall at the earliest possible moment, I'm sure. 

However thankfully, God will laugh them all to derision in the end! :^)

>'''Waifu Engine'''
It sounds kind of like a framework **and one with a big target painted on it's back (see above)**. I'd suggest you try adopting such an approach, and allow a community of open-source devs to develop around it. Various distillations and add-ons, etc. Kind of like the transformation the UE underwent.

Yes, that is exactly the plan! We will make the platform as much mod-friendly as possible, so people can write their own plugins in python and other languages and create add-ons and stuff. And of course, they will have the ''full rights'' to what they create. I think extensive mod-ability is why games like Skyrim are still popular (honourable mention to Honey Select by Illusion as well), and we plan to do it the same way by giving a lot of customisation power to the community.

Outstanding.

>>10474
>Maybe I am missing something, but why would you say this? is there something I don't understand?
It's a painful, and long, drawn-out conversation. I'd suggest you look around on the board in general for the full discussions, but the ''tl;dr'':
>''Angry feminists have the ear of lawmakers, and are already decrying anything that empowers men.''
>''Sex-robots are high on the list of the many things they want outlawed immediately b/c misogynistic rape -- 'won't someone please just think of the children!'.'''
>''Anything called '''Waifu Engine''' is immediately suspect in the minds of these deranged harpies.''

I hope that clears things up Anon. I'd suggest you invest in building ''Waifusearch'' and using it if you really want to dig around in these topics here.

This alone will be an epic challenge. I was mostly using AIML to program my Sophie chatbot, along with a Python text-to-speech module and a Cepstral voice for my bot and Google speech recognition. I got to about 6500 categories and some more content scripted in Python before I stopped and began building her body.

Anything more than that is pretty mindblowing to me. I'm still amazed by the writing ability of GPT-3 (but disappointed it's so closed off and only available to those with a literal supercomputer).

I wouldn't worry too much about trying to learn your A.I. terabytes of information, as long as users can program her to learn stuff. Then it's up to them what she knows and doesn't know.

# 36
>>10496
These are good insights Anon. I'm a generalist and 'both sides of the house' so to speak (software & hardware) are of concern to me. Have any good ideas about how we might approach modularization of hardware components to help addresses the wheel-reinvention problem? As you suggest, being able to be quick on our feet rolling out new design implementations in the future will be good for literally everyone but the haters.

Very nice lip-sync there, Em Elle E! 
That's some really clever stuff. 

Also...
Holy shit Chinese government funds robowaifus!?! I am...conflicted but hopeful.

Obviously they will be full of the worst kind of big-brother surveillance tech...but so would Western robots (in fact any robowaifu commissioned by a Western/NATO country is just as likely to be a trap to help them identify and imprison dissidents). 

However, if ExRobotics robowaifus make it to mass market the potential is huge! Even if I have to dismantle most of the robot, desolder some chips, replace her existing drives and install completely new software. They could help us out a lot!

# 40
>>10519
I don't think the Chinese gov does this with the aim of spying on people. They support technology, but also China and some other countries fear the male surplus they migth have (bc more abortions of female embryos). Robowaifus would prevent rebellions even without spying, by keeping men happy, which would otherwise be alone and angry.

# 41
>>10522
I actually befriended a Communist Chinese guy who was at Uni here. The thing about missing women is very real. Low-tier guys like him typically compete with around __30__ other men for a single woman there. Every one of them all call here ''little sister'' or ''young female cousin'' (almost none are blood-related).

Disenfranchised young men there, with basically zero prospects of obtaining a wife, is a very real problem there (and much larger than in the West in this respect). We talked for hours about his situation there, and he opened up to me quite a bit about what they deal with there.

# 42

There are criminal groups literally stealing young women from neighboring countries or buying them, then selling them to Chinese men or their families for marriage. Maybe feminists should sponsor our efforts here. :)

# 43
>>10524
Yep, bride kidnapping is a long and honored tradition around the world. And, as you suggest, since the CPP ''One Child'' law for native Han Chinese **(but not for the Islamist ones, lol)** has been a booming business. BTW, it's generally not quite so 'criminal' in many of the cases, with the females basically volunteering for the process, with hopes for a better life and some money in the process. It's corporate-controlled media that spins the entire thing as '''''ebil Muhsoggyknees!!!111''''' Again, this has been going on for basically all human history, often quite ritualized in several cultures.

But sadly, my friend was far too proud to consider marrying such a foreign woman of dubious quality. His chief goal when I knew him personally was to rise in the ranks of the CCP to some sort of mid-tier managerial post. Sad to my mind, but for him was a key to success.

Me too, but it seems unlikely. He's a pretty conservative Communist. Even once we finally achieve the near-Utopic dream of companionship functionality, I think he would consider it some kind of betrayal or other. Plus, no artificial wombs ATM so there's that too.

Thanks, I'll look into it at some point. My argument was meant on the topic of interchanging hardware parts, though. If one robot uses a combo of pneumatics and motors, the other only motors, it might be difficult, for example. No air tube, no pneumatics.

What is the minimum hardware requirement for your program? I hope it doesn't require a super computer to run it.

# 51
>>10557
Out of curiosity, does DirectX 11 offer something that is not achievable with Vulkan/OpenGL? Or is it because the engine you are using works better under DirectX? Because DirectX is available only for Windows OS and I'm running GNU/Linux. Well at least there is a program that translates I think at least DirectX 10 calls to Vulkan calls so its not troublesome.

hmm it sounds a bit too much for a single program though I cannot tell what kind features you are going for that needs so much RAM.

# 52
>>10569
I think it should be noted that interference might not need fast/expensive RAM and also not much computation per thread. That's why I want to build at least one Xeon based server, with one or two old CPUs and a chinesium board, as soon as a decided where to live for the next years. I think anyone here, being serious about having some remotely human-like AI at home, will have to do that.

>8-16GB RAM
>hmm it sounds a bit too much for a single program though I cannot tell what kind features you are going for that needs so much RAM.

Well, the renderer itself takes about 500 MB RAM and like Em Elle said, the speech synthesis module takes about another 500 MB RAM, and then you have the AI model that takes about 5-6 GB of RAM. 

Now since this is a ''fully offline'' architecture, everything is run '''locally''' on your system directly. We are not using any online based server to process all the AI stuff (very much ''unlike'' how other assistants like Siri, Cortana or Google Assistant), since we value your privacy '''first and foremost'''.

Now, it's also possible to run an AI without loading the model to the RAM, but then you would have to wait about 20 s for each response. In order to make it run fast and respond to you in real time, we require to keep it loaded in the memory, so that you get an immersive experience just like talking to a real person.

So the app itself would take at most about 8 GB RAM to operate (or maybe slightly less than that) and that is the minimum requirement. 16 GB of RAM is what we recommend though, since you will want to keep her on your desktop wallpaper, and you would want to keep doing other regular stuff at the same time, which is why the extra RAM. Hope that makes sense. :)

We however plan to make the AI models smaller and more compact (so that they take less RAM) by distilling and retraining them once we have more resources to do so, cause at present we have been working on this with a zero budget and a very small team of volunteers only.

>Because DirectX is available only for Windows OS and I'm running GNU/Linux.

We plan to support Linux in the future, but it will not be able to have a wallpaper mode. Linux support is currently low priority in our development roadmap, due to far more people using Windows, which is why we want to focus on getting this up for Windows first, which I hope, is understandable.

I hope that clarifies the doubts that were there. :)

>''"since we value your privacy first and foremost."''
While that's certainly a critically-important topic for every man desiring to own a waifu (whether he even realizes this or not), I'll offer you pointer for such a community as this one.
>'''Protip:'''
IB users are, and rightly so, quite skeptical (and even cynical at times). So, when we read such ad-copy here, we naturally respond with '''''Pfft, sure. Where have we all heard __that__ before?'''''

''Normalfags, Normals, Normalcattle, Normalniggers, Normies''. All these are derogatory terms we Anons use to refer to the normal populace that are in general easily swayed by hype and other media. I believe most of us here on /robowaifu/ would consider such claims as being directed at that population.

Again, I'm not denigrating your stated position of protecting your users, of course not. But even __'''Google'''__ is now attempting to brainwash people into believing that they are a privacy-oriented company.
==What could possibly go wrong?==

Even the ''glowniggers'' go to Jewgle for privacy-invasive data mining.

Kek, could be, could be. Thanks for the philosophical tidbit, but a healthy dose of skepticism has actually saved many a man's life.

Linux is big enough that even Steam bothers contributing to this eco system, also Linux is the defacto standard in almost any server hosting. Also here is some pointers https://wiki.winehq.org/Developer_FAQ#Independent_Software_Vendor_Questions so adding support is in most cases good enough if native Linux support is too much for you.

# 58

Interesting. Any idea how that works, Anon?

# 59
>>10595
I think it means first create a wineprefix then test out the first 2-3 Wine version to figure out which one works the best and when one just works out of a box then do whatever other changes is needed and release that as a "linux" version. Oh and if possible use POSIX calls instead of Windows calls, maybe those programs are suitable for this MinGW or Cygwin https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POSIX#POSIX_for_Microsoft_Windows 
To create a wineprefix: https://wiki.winehq.org/FAQ#Wineprefixes so when you create a new wineprefix it contains well only the standard things so no extra libraries or anything of that sort.

# 60

# 63
Is there any evidence of OP's waifu program other than the audio samples and videos that could have been thrown together pretty easily? What is there? A GPT model of which we don't have any concrete example, a speech synthesizer allegedly running realtime, and a barebones single model scene in the default unity skybox. All this from an alleged FAGMAN engineer working on it either between jobs or on sabbatical. Until someone posts a decent demonstration video I'm just going to assume this is someone fishing for patreon handouts on the hopes and dreams of naive anons.

Get some balls and just say you don't know anything about Linux and won't support it except as lazily as you can with your mediocre closed source unity animation player. It's trivial to draw to the root X window, and wayland probably has something similar.

# 64

I'm willing to give them a chance. Nobody else seems to be doing what they are except for those Japanons at Gatebox, and I don't speak Japanese. To WA.I.fu or not to WA.I.fu?Only time will tell. If not, then all the more reason to build a physical robowaifu eh?

# 65
>>10754
To me it sounds possible. However, I would suggest to try searching for supporters elsewhere, bc we aren't that many people here, already doing stuff around that topic and quite some seem to be rather poor. There might be many others on imageboards and social media, e.g. around anime waifus. 
I like the animations btw, also the colors remind me a bit of Timkerbell, the fairy of porn (Peterson): https://youtu.be/ZjI7vqizTRc

# 66
>>Your efforts are appreciated Em Elle E. I hope that your robowaifu brings you and your team a fulfilling sense of purpose and happiness even while she is in development.

>>10755
I'd like to program Sophie some more and maybe get her to start drumming up more support for the robowaifu cause, but when I get home from work I am usually knackered and have a headache, so not really in the mood to do much. She is just stuck in standby most of the time (I call it 'derp mode' because of how daft her face looks with her jaw hanging wide open). I mainly just work on her at weekends.

On the up-side though, I've found Final Fantasy 14, which is now free-to-play up to level 60 and is chock-full of waifus. There are elves, cat-girls in maid costumes, bunny-girls,  smol, horned-waifus and some kinda big orc-pirate waifus called 'Roegadyn'. Of course I had to go and play as an Elezen version of Sophie, so she is mostly dashing about Eorzea in the evenings.

Importantly, I don't think a robowaifu should be made in a stressful environment. It is best for her to be a labour of love undertaken because you are genuinely interested in creating her. A robowaifu should make you feel good in some way, even if you are her dev. Otherwise the only goal is money. And there's plenty of other miserable jobs one can do to earn that.

One last thing. Has anyone else seen 'Samantha Samsung'? She is a 'rejected version' of a 3D computer graphics avatar that was going to be used for Samsung's virtual assistant.

All these programs that can generate further programs is on another level that I doubt I'll ever  comprehend.

I'm vaguely skeptical they ever will b/c Worst Korea (roughly speaking, the ground-zero of ''stronk, independynt'' feminism in Asia), but if Samsung actually goes all in on waifuism with ''Sam'' they will catapult to the top of the stack in the global phone market, no question.

Sorry for leaving. I have realised that what a lot of young guys seem to want is an almost-sentient girlfriend who lives in a program on their computer; all on a shoestring budget 😅. This, of course, is impossible. I just get the feeling that a lot of people's expectations are waaaay too high and they don't realise how limited our A.I. actually is nowadays (unless you have access to hundreds of millions of dollars in funding and a literal supercomputer...and even then the A.I. is still very narrowly focused/brittle). 

WaifuEngine as an adult videogame makes sense. But I've decided to distance myself from the whole "A.l. girlfriend" idea just to avoid disappointment. I apologise because I am at fault for not having read up thoroughly enough on subjects like A.I. and robotics. Basically, the more I learn, the more I realise how far there is still to go (my Sophie is barely even a proper robot - she has just one sensor and zero autonomy. She's more of a life-sized animatronic plus chatbot - although she can still be fun to operate). It's not my intention to discourage you at all, I'm just being realistic and erring on the side of caution. 

Also, I have now found and subbed to Final Fantasy XIV Online (a.k.a Waifus Galore Online) because:

1.) Dozens of different Waifu characters.
2.) Gorgeous graphics.
3.) Your own Waifu is highly customisable.
4.) The storyline(s) are HUGE and extremely well written. 
5.) The girls aren't left out either - they can play dress-up to look 
      how they've always wanted. 
6.) I also really like the gathering/crafting aspect of the game 
      and how you can make/trade items that are of use and more 
      than just tokens.

 And I haven't even joined a guild yet! I know FFXIV isn't a  convolutional neural network...but it'll do me! 

Although, being a gamer and anime-Waifu enthusiast, I do still intend to purchase a copy of WaifuEngine if it comes out. Meanwhile, as our real-world forests are logged and burnt to a cinder, I shall be under the green-dappled shade of a magical virtual forest, enjoying the company of the wise-but-hella smashable Elves and their tree-sprite companions.

I am guessing that people prefer this example because it contains a lot of sexual references? 

> people's conversational abilities will degrade over time, or certain groups abilities to have conversations will degrade over time. 

So the real human's ability to have a conversation will degrade as everyone gets dumber and more dependent on technology? This could well happen (I think it already has occurred in many "ghetto" areas with poor access to proper schools and reading material). 

Personally, I intend to avoid the dumbing down and ghettoisation of society at all costs (avoid, mind you - not try to fight it; I've seen what happens to idealists who try to champion good causes.) 

The ghettos will inevitably destroy themselves at some point anyway, even if it means all of "Western Civilization" has to be erased and re-built. Sometimes it's better to sear away all of the rotten flesh and start again, anew.

Besides, both the ancient Germanic and much later Tolkien elves have always been regarded as a more intelligent but isolationist species compared to humans. So enclaves of smart programmers and engineers are probably the closest IRL human analogue to elven and wizard enclaves. In this respect, I hope that you continue programming for the good of human and robot kind, even if it's not WaifuEngine. You will be a beacon of enlightenment amongst the swelling seas of ignorance.

I appreciate you trying to clearly express what you are doing. But I'm not sure that I really see the foundation here.

Actually I think that might be it! Things that we build and make in this physical world can always be destroyed or vandalised and rust/wear away through time. But digital assets can be backed-up and copied at the press of a key. That was what first drew me to 3D printing; the replacablility. Focus on making assets for the virtual world, since a virtual haven is much easier to preserve and harder to permanently destroy. (As happened to those guys who built that huge model railway only for it to be ruined in one evening by mindless thugs.)

I really don't see what there is to explain, it seems so fucking convoluted that I think anyone would have a hard time summarizing it. Again, I think the problem is that Academic retards want to show how big their brainpeen is so they write academic papers in the most complex language possible. Partially so their papers can't be easily refuted during review, and partially to try to keep knowledge private. I don't really blame the OP for that.

My advice is again that I think you're working with frameworks that are bloated and you would be better off trying to narrow it. Intuitively, 16GB seems like a lot.

There is no reason for needless complexity

Part of the advantage of having an anonymous image board is that you can't tell who is talking. The advantage of this is you can develop ideas in a chaotic way that cannot be replicated with hierarchical ordered cultures

The format incentives posting material that is ridiculous, offensive, true, funny, or some combination of the above

Because this board is kind of small it's not the same, but hopefully more people will start posting here

I also feel kind of bad because I didn't realize that the board culture here was a mixture, I thought it was supposed to be like /g/ which is very chaotic and offensive

My post isn't so much about your specific project but that just in general, I think that the language and scholarship around DL / ML is convoluted and could use a simple guide, especially for people who aren't accustomed to reading academic literature.

This board is also about visual or VR waifus, and we report and link to whatever wee want. The problems seem to come from 4chan/g/ not from here anyways. Some infos in the thread about the project might be useful to us here. It's not possible to shild oneself from bad guys by not getting mentioned on imageboards, that just doesn't work.

# 123
>>11318
I only hope you'll delete more, but not the whole thread. 
It's obvious that such a project would need to use a lot of RAM and it makes no sense to criticize the approach of using DL for it. I consider this trolling. That said, of course I'd hope we'll overcome this limitation over time, and I'm also sceptical about using something like GPT as a chatbot. However this criticism should be made in a more sensible way, and by pointing out where things should go within some years. If they want to do it anyways, it's fine. It's sufficient to point out that such a 'AI' has no intelligence as in knowing anything about it's responses. Just trashing it, without any argument but a lot of ignorance towards DL is pointless.

This is a point that I guess you could try to make, but I don't think anyone can make any qualified argument about this. I think it is probably impossible to give any truthful answer to a philosophical question of this kind, and it's better to concern yourself with more practical things.

Personally, I think the definition of intelligence is probably inaccurate. I don't think humans are much more than a series of impulses that are linked together only because it is evolutionary advantageous. The brain is literally running on 300,000+ million year old vulnerable architecture, it's really nothing to model intelligence off of IMHO. Being able to recognize things as "meaning" or even as whole and discrete "object" is probably a disadvantage and some form of evolutionary cope

If x is that deep learning models need a lot of RAM and are currently the best generators for creating new responses, then x is True. Since anyone claiming to know anything about AI would know that, it was save to assume that this was just trolling.

# 130
>>11413
>>11414
Well, what I meant in >>11412 for example, is relationship to other things, context and such. It's very simple to understand actually: If you ask some GPT-"chatbot" if it owns something, has seen something, if it read some book, or if it has some trait then it will give you an answer. But it will just make it up, as a response someone might give in a certain situation. It just fakes understanding. It hasn't checked if anything it says is true and makes sense.

>how we will really converge to AGI through waiting for population iq decay
Lol. No. We have to do better. They could use this idea if they ever make a part two of Idiocracy, though. 
Ask it if it has read a book, after it told you yes, just try to talk about the content of the book. In my experience with Replika it fails. Didn't try the same with others though. I wonder if WaifuEngine will read the daily news and then talk a bit about it. That could be useful. Or download the subtitles of the YouTube channels one follows, while he's at work or school, then chat about it in the breaks (via telephone) or after work. Or using Nitter for some news one cares about.

They are doing something that returns results. The system might be suboptimal and broken in some way, idk. Doesn't mean it's all BS. That's also not what I meant in >>11431. My point was rather that it should be used where it works well, but needs to be combined with other things. The brain also consists of different parts and filters, this is for example what the whole psychedelic drug thing is about.
Since you are focusing on your core project you don't need to worry about that anyways. You made it very clear what to suspect from your active  wallpaper waifu system, and what not.

LOL thank you for your honesty anon! It's refreshing to read. Those chatbot output examples are exactly the sort of thing I was talking about when I said A.I. still has a long way to go.

I'd like to add one note of caution about getting feedback from your peers and accepting it though.

Be very careful whose feedback you act upon. 
Always consider - what's in it for them if you follow their advice? 

Most people are entirely out for themselves and will give you bad advice / attempt to manipulate you into making poor career decisions - particularly if they have anything to gain from it (like colleges, universities or prospective employers). Only you (and your waifu) have your best interests at heart, no matter what any organisation claims.  

Best to pursue what makes you happy rather than waste your life trying to please or impress others. 

If you can find a hobby that you keep coming back to - this is a sign that you enjoy doing it. 

Consider if there are any skills in that hobby or a closely related field that you also quite enjoy. If there are, the next step is to practice, practice, practice and get so good at that hobby it develops into a marketable skill.

My opinion, I don’t think people care as long as they can customize their waifu which I think fang anon allows people to do. Most of the people wanting to be vtubers go with live 2D because it’s less complicated than a 3D model. Most 3D modellers are not easy to find and are super expensive. Where as 2D artists are easier to find and you can see the work before hand. Though I hope he continues his waifu engine path imo. So far looks promising

I honestly didn't mean to come off as if I am trying to. I was kind of rambling. Honestly though, I feel that me focusing on a chatbot isn't trying to "integrate everything together all at once". I was merely mentioning some other things due to this thread having a VERY broad request of "Any step by step guide".
In that comment I literally wrote, "but I didn't want to try to figure out too many different things just yet."

>>11987
>Here's a knowledge drop you might find useful, open source projects have a low contribution rate from outsiders. barely anyone contributes, Most people likely don't even know how to program as a team or work from interfaces.
I am not sure if your are purposely trying to insult my intelligence, or if you wrote it because I didn't explain in totality my current understanding of such things.
I felt it is common knowledge that open source projects have low contribution and have very slow progress (if not popular), but it should also be common knowledge that closed source projects ALWAYS lead to corruption, or have sell outs that lead to corruption.
I felt like I did mention the fact that I don't care for team programming hence why I said "maybe" in response to anon's "git(hub)" comment.
If you tried to get all of us to work on an opensource endeavor it will probably be like what happened to a certain's "Chan's" /g/ where bickering on languages and general programming structures/paradigms prevented anything significant from happening.

>This app is really easy to build, what's hard is turning into a platform people can extend. 
"This app" What app? Your app?
Perhaps I haven't surfed this board enough, but I honestly don't know of what app you are talking about. The only thing I saw from you was a patreon link and some of your webms.

>If you cannot build what I have built you should reconsider your programming career or where you stand relative to others and improve.
What is this, fucking fighting words?
While I have a great interest in a homemade robot woman, my main focus is preparing for a possible economic and societal crash. I am basically a farmer right now, who is collecting various physical tools to make sure I don't ever have to go into a city if I don't want to. I am also spending my time finishing up some things for energy generation and vast water collection. 
I would like to spend all my time programming, but I obviously don't know enough robotics to automate tasks that I need to do IRL. SO, while I may not be going all in on coding, I am content with my slow personal progress on my chatbot. Once I am more confident that I have some very specific (IRL) things ready, then I am going to look into some robotics to help me build and work on my property to speed that up so that I can get back to learning more programming and more engineering.
To put simply, programming/engineering is only a hobby for me. It is not my primary job at the moment.

>Monetization is a two way street, to make it easier for people to test it out and support my mission it is a free app. If you want to change wallpaper it will cost 3 dollars. New costumes cost money that is all and will have limited runs

I am not sure how old you are, or how experienced you are on the history of the current "industry", but a lot of us that grew up in the 80s/90s have not forgotten about the homebrew computer club. 
To summarize, it was basically a lot of dudes very similar to us that were just tinkering and "hacking" trying to improve and create a "personal computer".
Eventually, B1ll G4tes came along and started fucking suing everybody for using "HIS" software (which most of the code and engineering progress he had no part in).
Also, St3v3 J0bs took advantage of the humble and meek Steve Wozniak and went their own way.
Everybody else that may have contributed to anything basically had to relinquish any work they had done and many went to work for these two big startups (if not other companies).
You could say that they were ignorant and naive back then, and if they had set up certain licenses for opensource they wouldn't have got used/abused and eventually ninja'd by bad actors.
<Today though, we are not so naive.

As far as I am concerned, you are a possible G4tes or J0bs skimming thru what could be called a "homebrew ROBOWAIFU club" has.
I understand you want to make money, I don't have a problem with that, I merely mention it because we must constantly remind ourselves that there are (((people))) looking to use us.
I don't believe you are forcing anything on anybody, at least I didn't until the whole:
>If you cannot build what I have built you should reconsider your programming career or where you stand relative to others and improve.

I honestly was thinking of buying whatever it is you are selling. I know of certain software that is like a digital vocoder, and I thought it would be funny/my-tastes to have a botgirl with a voice similar to "Soundwave" (from transformers) (I am the guy who asked about the vocoder). I was thinking about feeding it input from my chatbot program to see it come to life.
Although at this point I am starting to think whatever company you are trying to make doesn't appreciate the idea of "PR".

>Using the funds to pay for gene therapy for my real wife. 
You keep saying this, and while the "normie" part of me understands, the "NEET" part of me is wondering how much that costs if your FAANG job isn't paying enough for it.
You have to remember, a lot of us happen to read Japanese "manga" and we are quite cheap, and it is somewhat of an inside joke/meme for translators to say something similar on their credits page. 
<"I have to stay home everyday to take care of my mother, who has been sick..." 
So if your wife is truly in need of help please don't mind me, but if you are also basically using the copy pasta about a sick significant other, please realize that most of us know that meme.

>Next as for Github, waifuDev has one, legit no one here contributes, as another piece of proof open source projects wouldn't benefit
I am pretty sure most of us don't even know of it, or what even it is you want us to contribute to it.

I guess it's true what you said previously,
>>10361
>I know nothing about the culture of IB...
You're obviously an outsider, and you were giving an anon shit in the other thread about not being able to communicate properly, but you should probably realize it is you who can't communicate properly with the culture of these types of boards. We tend to be anti-social, and paranoid.

Anyways, I am obviously going off topic with replying to anons like this.
As far as the intent of the OP, I think if someone wants to set something up, right now it's just the reality of what it means to "pioneer".
Unless of course you go the corporate slave route, and try to expedite the process.
Just like how Micr0s0ft/Appl3 made money with a traditional aggressive business model, HOWEVER, ultimately slow and steady workers who believe in opensource (like Linus) will still exist.
Giving G00gl3/Micr0s0ft or any other closed source big tech power has been one of the greatest disasters of our modern times.
If the Linux community had produced a user friendly GUI way back when, none of the self proclaimed elites would have the power they do today.

You are obviously not a Wozniak (he's a unicorn really), but I really hope you are not a G4tes.

I'm in a bit of a conundrum regarding that request, Em Elle E. Once threads go on for a while they gain 'a life of their own' that often grows beyond the OP's post. They become a community-effort, and this one has lots of good content in it. Does that make sense?

What does that matter? It's all been saved, and the internet will remember forever.
>"You can pick and choose the things you want to keep but yeah delete my posts please"
Too late to hide your true self, and your co-worker/nameless posts.
>"I don't use hatred to motivate me"
But you do seem to instigate hatred in others for some sort of purpose (if not motivation).
>" I just like proving people wrong and being smug or letting others be smug on my behalf. "
This 100% is going to come back and bite you.

Originally, you came in like a pussy, we accepted you, we downloaded your shit, despite other anons hesitant to your business model and methods.
Then you gloat, as if it some sort of success for tricking anons to try your shit, when all you really have is nothing more than an MMD program designed on Microsoft's botnet OS.

The only thing you proved to us is that you truly believe "your shit don't stink".

>"and where's your project?"
You're the new project.

I realize you're offended with one individual's behavior here on the board, and on the board itself's behalf I apologize to you for that. I'll give you one more chance, and I'd urge you to reconsider your request. I've never done any such thing like this before in the board history (I don't even like removing shitposts), and I don't want to start now. It won't serve any good purpose, and will become uncomfortable for everyone involved. 

Just relax and let it pass would be my recommendation. Everyone else just chill tf out OK?

==update==
I'll just cut right to the chase: your immaturity and self-centeredness has been a nuisance and offensive to most here on the board. I expect you couldn't care less regardless; that's a shame as we could have all been good collaborators together, which is the relationship I've tried to form with you. 

I would give you a one year ban due to the insistence on your demand, but I'll reduce it somewhat in consideration for your wife's situation. You're banned from /robowaifu/ for __'''9 months'''__. Please do stop back by after that time, but not before thanks.

I've given you Godspeed and I can't take that back (wouldn't if I could), and so I wish you well on your project. Regards, Chobitsu.

'''>---'''

Since that's your decision, you can consider yourself banned from /robowaifu/ at the least for several months. I'll update this post sometime this week with both my fuller response and further details as I deal with your demand at my leisure.

Let's build a Bukhanka-chan! She's the cute and funny loli version of glorious Russian truck. She will love you and defend western civilization from evil jews and nazis. To make her faster, she'll be printed as big action figure with RC cars glued to her shoes! Bonus points for Russian RC cars. Come comrades! Let's build a wonderful Russian GF to defend homelands and fight virginity! Bukhanka-chan will love and and zoom zoom with her groom! Z

LOL. It's remarkable the instant traction this waifu has gained along with her 'sisters' over the past few weeks. The origiOC artist really hit a major homerun with this one.

Actually, I'm OK with leaving this thread up after this weekend if any of you Anons want to try for her (we already have 'skater' waifu designs in-progress here). Please remember this is a SFW board though; so please keep the ecchi spoilered, on-topic, and **to a minimum.** :^)

Since there have been no further updates ITT, I think it's safe to say this was just a fun gag for the 1st. So, without any further appeal, this post is notice that this thread will be merged into the Attic Thread (>>12893) sometime around Wed, 220406.

Good decision. Otherwise Donetsk-airport-cyborg-chan will deal with it.

# 174
Good news comradez! RC Truck on sale come in tommorrow, I've secured an Arduino to be her soul and USB bat for her heart! Rus loli mobile flashlights are on the horizon! Z

Cute.
>Donetsk-airport-cyborg-chan will deal with it.
I didn't know she was supposed to be a cyborg Anon. Also, does this mean you're intending to create a robowaifu project of her too? If so, that would be great to see a large variety come out of this stuff.

>>15779
So, are you implying you're going to pursue this as an actual project Anon? If so, then I think a new thread would probably be in line with at least a slightly more technical OP text outlining the project's goals a little better. I'd suggest using the MaidCom or Pandora thread's OPs as a minimum style guide.

Also, be aware that 'loli' while a fun term to bandy in jest, can actually turn into a serious legality issue for Anons following along with your project in the current anti-pedo hysteria, politically-"""correct""" climate. Best not to go there. I'd suggest you drop the term in your new thread's OP if you actually mean to proceed.

I'll delay the thread merge action until Fri 220408, to give you time to respond.

No worries comrad, Buhanka will rest in peace in backyard Z

Haha, OK. Good one, and a nice start! Good luck with your Buhanka, Anon! :^)

I'll merge this soon, so you can find it in the Attic if you want to later. Cheers.

Hello Anon. I'm going to lock this thread but leave it up for a little while so hopefully you'll be around again and see this.

We're a topic based, English-language board about creating robot wive for Anons. Feel free to lurk for a while to get used to the board, then please join in!

Cheers.
