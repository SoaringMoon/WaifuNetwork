Can a waifubot's AI be done with only neural networks?

I mean, thinking in NN as black boxes and circles as inputs/outputs, could we get to the point where a system like the one I poorly draw in the picture can be possible?

#drossel #ai
When I say AI, I mean actual robots that learn how to use their own inputs and outputs, not just chatbots. Are there any downloadable AI programs? I'm the OP of the Drossel thread, and I'd like to see if there's any downloadable programs for this shit. Also, I'd like some tips for inserting mounts for servos and shit inside the Drossel model.

There's shit-tier AI that comes embedded in boards such as Sparkfun Edge (tensorflow voice recognition) and ESP-EYE (face recognition), pretty limited but otherwise offline after firmware updates. I have those boards but haven't started using them yet.

#tensorflow  #deep_learning
Tensorflow might be your best bet. Deep learning “AI”, which is really just fancy statistics, is the current meme that lets robots learn about their bodies.  
  
Honestly I don’t know how possible any of this is without citing some Ph.D research papers.

Could this be implemented in logic gates/software? Might be a good way to make robowaifus ai

it can but there is no point to it.We already have a better choice with the A.I. t . A.I. researcher
