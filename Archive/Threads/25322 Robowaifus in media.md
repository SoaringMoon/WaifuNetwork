After reading anon's Robowaifu fiction bread, I wondered what media is out there that already predominately features a robowaifu(s) as an important character. Animu and mango are obvious choices (pic related), but surely there are live action movies as well.

A lad over at >>>/britfeel/ made this and gave us his blessing to it. Literally the best rip I've seen of the Chobits OP.

>>2676
Same lad also did my second-favorite Hand-Made May.

# 4
Maybe not directly related, but the movie "Her" by Spike Jonze comes to mind. The AI is disembodied and it could be seen as more of a cautionary tale about falling in love with a botnet, but some of themes it touches on might be relevant to this board.

# 5
>>2978
Thanks Anon. Yep, I'm quite sure it's relevant to this board's interests!

# 6
/robowaifu/ should have a movie night to build the community and discuss themes related to AI and robotics.  The movies should obviously be related to AI and robotics.

That phrasing gives off school day activity vibes. Is nice.

My personal favorite is Yokohama Kaidashi Kikou.

# 10
>>3662
Yeah, that's literally how we should spin the whole thing Anon, good thinking! :^)

>>3663
Pics pls.

# 11
> Pics pls.

This shows probably what I consider peak aesthetic x slice of life x robowaifu. I highly recommend it since its only 2 episodes.



>>3664

to be completely honest I've been hoping once VR kicks off it could become something like ReLife where people can go and somewhat relive high school life like we see in some anime's (think ReLife). Kind of an embarrassing thought but I guess why not put it out there? 



In that same line of thought it would be pretty useful to use VR for robowaifus meetups once more users joined. It would keep people from being harassed irl since robowaifus is one of the targets of the culture war going on right now and we could probably host our on servers. The only issue would be people who don't have VR capabilities would be left out.

# 12
>>3665

I'll also add, this show is also really made by its sound design and ASMR like voicing.

# 13
>>3665
Sounds great, I'll grab a copy. Any particular one you'd recommend?

>It would keep people from being harassed irl since robowaifus is one of the targets of the culture war going on right now and we could probably host our on servers. 
It is indeed, and it hasn't really even begun, currently it's only the batshit screeching harpies. Normalcattle 3DPD don't even realize the implications yet. Once they do in a broad way, we'll be seeing the pussy pass exerted like never in history.

Any yeah, we have a Visual Waifu thread Anon where VR is the prime topic I don't think it's been repopulated yet after the move though.

Thanks for the info about the show!

# 14
>>3667

> Any particular one you'd recommend?

Do you mean VR meetup wise or Yokohama Kaidashi Kikou-DVD wise?

# 15
>>3669



ohh, in that case I can only recommend the first OVA since I haven't seen the second (Quiet Country Cafe) and I'm waiting to get it for a special occasion.

# 16

An anime I discovered a few years ago, Saber Marionette, shows a planet on which there are no human females (colony ship accident). New men are produced by cloning, and any female is actually a gynoid. As a potential future, I'd think it'd be incredible (though we would need artificial wombs).
Also discovered my waifu in the first episode XD

# 20
>>4419
Yeah, that's a nice series. Something about those oldschool animus is nicely distinctive in the art styles.

# 21
>>4422
I get ya. The older style is cool, cute, and distinct from real life. At the same time it's not too cute-sie (?) or moe (though some moe is nice).

# 22
Recommendation: Boku no Tsuma wa Kanjou ga Nai / My Wife Has No Emotion 

Link: https://mangadex.org/title/46011/boku-no-tsuma-wa-kanjou-ga-nai



This is about a salary worker that lives alone with his domestic robot that he regards as his wife. It's a light-hearted slice-of-life about him learning how he should care for his robotic wife and their day-to-day life together. I found the manga endearing and I think you guys might enjoy it as well.

# 23

Thanks Anon, much appreciated.

How good is that show? https://www.anime-planet.com/anime/andromeda-stories


My favorite show in terms of entertainment value related to Robowaifus is so far Clockwork Planet  and of course the Alita: Battle Angel live action movie. Doesn't mean these are the best waifus, just the show/movie is the best from what I've seen. Others are to much slice of life or not really thrilling for other reasons. I think Butobi CPU and Unbreakable Machine Doll are my second favorites, though the latter one is incomplete as a Anime, and the Chinese "Manga" wasn't available in English. They all have in common to have some other interesting story instead being about a shy boy with problems and some waifu. 
Outside of Anime I also like Terminator SCC a lot. Cameron really is a fascinating piece of work, and not only optically. I think it might be the best impersonation of a fembot ever.

# 40
>>6770

It's worth a watch. It's fun and 85 minutes long.



It's a bit shallow and wacky and things happen just for the sake of happening, no particular writing skill can be attributed to the writer.

The art style is a solid early 80s style but doesn't stand out.

The animation is also unremarkable.

It's very original and the idea behind its originality is very good at least.



It's really a decent anime that's worth a watch, it's not one of those obscure OVAs that turn out to be amazing and for some reason still fell through the cracks and into obscurity.

You will enjoy it a lot more if you like shoujo, science fiction meets fantasy, originality, and that era in anime.

# 41
Recently I watched Chobits again, for the first time in years. While I thought the anime was very cute and all, especially Chi, and I chuckled a little bit at all the innuendos, I felt that it was overall lacking. I wish the plot was a little bit more engaging, and if not that, then I felt that the amount of episodes needed to be reduced. The plot at the end was foreshadowed, but I still feel like they rushed it and that the length of the anime should have probably been reduced to like 18 episodes or a little less. It seemed that the final 6-7 episodes just exploded in your face. But I guess transitioning from a SOL perverted romantic comedy to a Sci-Fi plot is pretty hard.

But overall, I liked it. The cuteness saved it for me. The next /robowaifu/-themed anime I'll probably watch will be either the Half-Broken Music Box OVA or Koukaku no Pandora.

# 42
>>6846
For me, Chobits was where I first realized that an Anon conceivably could actually have his own robowaifu, and how that could possibly radically change his life for the better.

It's "only" a manga and has no description on Anime-Planet... https://www.anime-planet.com/manga/latin

Anyone tried Violet Evergarden? It's very beloved by some, but others think the story is quite lame. She's a former weapon, but the story is only about feelings, writing letters, her becoming more human-like. I'm gonna look into it sooner or later.

I made a list with links to more infos on most known  anime shows about fembots/robowaifus, without hentai but including some ecchi. Not all are on topic in a strict sense, because the fembots might be daughters, sisters, colleges, or warriors instead of waifus. In some cases I can only assume that the show includes robogirls, since the show is about various robots, but I haven't seen it yet.

And because it's really good and about a robot learning about the world, I mention one non-anime here: Terminator SCC https://terminator.fandom.com/wiki/Terminator:_The_Sarah_Connor_Chronicles

I won't watch 'SoltyRei' on the list above. It's not about a waifu, but a daughter and probably not a good anime. I ignored 'Battle Angel Alita', because she might have a human brain in her artificial body. Also, I did't like the anime that much. The live action movie is great, and on-topic because of her looks. 'Ghost in the Shell' is also about Cyborgs with human brains, but worth watching. I did include magical robot girls and dolls in the list above, where the technology is at least partially magic or something similar. 'Space Dandy' features a non-humanoid robot with a female voice. I can highly recommend the show, but I didn't include it in the list. I only put the 'Time of Eve Movie' on the list, but not the show. I think it's the same story, and I did't really like it that much. I did not include 'Vexille 2077', because it's the worst anime I've ever watched. 'Love Like Aliens' is even worse, but I wasn't able to watch much of it.

Some shows might have sequels or prequels, I didn't put in the links for those. You'll need to look on your own if there's more based on a show you like. Example:
Armitage III - Poly Matrix: https://www.anime-planet.com/anime/armitage-iii-poly-matrix
Armitage III - Dual Matrix: https://www.anime-planet.com/anime/armitage-iii-dual-matrix

Then there might be other shows including NPCs, like Overlord: https://www.anime-planet.com/anime/overlord

Wow, great work anon! This will come in handy! 



Does Violet Evergarden count? I don't think she's a robot, just an awkward human. She has robotic arms but that was because of the war. Good show though.

# 49
>>7008
Excellent. It would be great to see this turned into a /robowaifu/ infographic. Possibly grouped by theme. Everyone should add suggestions for anything else they think should be included.

# 50
>>7008

Iczer-1, it's about an android girl who has come to earth to save the world and it has yuri themes. One of my favorites, the soundtrack is also really good.



Then there's "Monkey Punch no Sekai - Alice". Part of the "überdegenerate" genre in anime, some guy makes a woman he hates into a robot, then his son tries to kill her.

# 51
>>7009
> Violet Evergarden
Oh wow, I only watched the first episode. If she's supposed to be human, then this is one of the dumbest storylines ever. 
- Supersoldier, only regarded as a weapon
- Wants to be disposed of if not usable
- Works with automatic dolls
- Wants to learn what love means
- Has arms out of metal
...

>>7010
Thanks, but maybe we first need to find out which of those shows have been watched by someone here on that board. Otherwise we might put shows in which don't really belong there.

# 52
>>7013

I've watched Andromeda Stories, Armitage III, the original Blade Runner movie, Buttobi CPU, Key the Metal Idol, Magical Pokaan, No Game No Life, Robot Carnival and Rozen Maiden.



Rozen Maiden has no robot girls, they're all doll girls. With doll joints and stuff. A big part of it is that they've been created by someone to be the perfect girl. Maybe it's close enough.

No Game No Life's robot girl is in its movie, not the main series.

All the others I've watched are primarily about robot girls or have important characters who are robot girls.

Robot Carnival is probably the most /robowaifu/ anime of all. It's a 3-part OVA of with a different story in every part, one of them is about this inventor type of guy who made a robotic woman. And she's beautiful.



I also remembered a few others:



>Megazone 23

Movie series, one important plot point and character already in the first movie is a computer named "Eve" who presents herself to humans as a woman on a screen. The soundtrack calls her "Sleeping Beauty," one of the movies has "The Awakening of Eve" as the title. 

>Terra e...

In this one there is a computer people call "Mother". It's only ever seen as a super intelligent computer.

>Tenchi Muyo!

It's a harem anime about this guy named Tenchi and all these women who lust after him for no reason. The main one, Ryo-Ohki, is a hyper advanced sort of organic robot made with real eggs from her "mother". Really blurring the lines, but keep in mind they also have organic spaceships and stuff, she's really "tech".

>El Hazard

A pivotal plot point and important character is a robot girl. Watch the OVA not the TV series.

Thanks, I wrote that I would out in magical dolls and robots. Since many are not about technology anyways, Rozen Maiden fits in imho. Construction, getting the parts, and stuff like that is a quite important part of the story. I found it boring at the beginning, but liked it later.

I myself watched A.D. Police Files, Armitage III, Blade Runner 2022 ( I think?!?), Butobi CPU, Chobits, Clockwork Planet, Kowarekake no orgel, Metropolis, Plastic Memories, Robot Girls Z, Saber Marionette (not completed, yet) Steel Angel Kurumi, Time of Eve Movie, Unbreakable Machine Doll, and Terminator SCC. However, yet I often only watched the first season in many cases. I also started watching Violet Evergarden, which might be OT anyways. Some others will be watched soon.

# 54
>>7013

Yeah, I thought the Violet Evergarden thing was weird too. I spent most of the series thinking she was a robot girl. It wasn't super clear and was confusing with the mechanical arms. I don't think anything major would change even if she was a robot girl. 



Still a great list that you made, Anon! Thanks

# 55

The second one (Monkey Punch) has a very bad rating though.

One more, I overlooked on my watch later list: https://www.anime-planet.com/anime/indian-summer - it's hard to find anyways.
And another ones I found through som tag lists, which might be interesting:

Coyote Ragtime Show: https://www.anime-planet.com/anime/coyote-ragtime-show

But we can delete Hal from the list above, since the robot is a guy.

Anime-Planet has some tags to find on-topic shows. However, some shows are missing the right ones or have wrong ones. Android is used as a generic term for humanoid robots. Cyborgs can be ones withna human brain or a human-like body but a CPU. Then there are shows which might have some fembot character, but it isn't the main protagonist.
We don't need to go through all of them, if they have poor ratings. Some are also very short e.g. some with Drossel. Feel free to go through the lists, I just think some filtering makes sense.

By all means, don't stop. The more exhaustive the initial list, the higher quality and more comprehensive the final infograph.

# 58
>>7019
One way I can see how this could be done, is listing shows by some well selected trait of the robowaifu of that particular show, or their shared traits if there are a few: Magical Doll, Angel, Maid, Gothic Lolita, Stoic, Amnesia, Clumsy, Rosy Cheeks, Scantily-clad,  Verbal Tic, Frequently-Naked, Pervert...
We already got lots of tags for it. Others we have to make-up on our own. Lime from Saber Marionette for example has nothing descriptive.

# 59
>>7020
Yes, seems reasonable to have tags like that at the bottom of each paragraph describing the show. Makes sense to me Anon. As far as the overall order goes, then rankings by the ratings, torrent DLs, etc. seems reasonable. Obviously community consensus here on /robowaifu/ is more important for our infographic than the general anime consumer population's but I suspect a nice dovetail there for this 'robot girl' genre regardless.

And these can be versioned as well, even once an initial agreement is conceded, it can always be modified somewhat with a newer version.

Sometimes it's necessary to wait for some show. I've got a lot of links like that. Sometimes after a year or so, someone is seeding...
Rare (anime) shows are of course the stuff which should be seeded regardless of ratio.

# 66
Would the gems from Land of the Lustrous count? I know they are not robots but they aren't biological and they break apart but can keep going in a similar way to robots. The way they all have the same body with white "skin" made me think they are prime candidates for robot conversion. It just looks like a white chassis to me! The only parts you'd have to change are the faceplate, eye sockets and wig.

# 67
>>7078
I don't know, haven't watched it. Problem is, there are many shows with some non-human  characters, some based on other forms of biology or another material. This could get out of hand and water down what this is about. Maybe we need some filters? Just some suggestions for what might be on-topic: 
- non-humans-females build by humans 
- if not build by humans, then the body needs to be out of some kind of mechanics and she needs to be in a relationship with a human, brains are some kind of computer or they are animated by some kind of magical force
- exceptions maybe if the story revolves a lot around how a mind work and/or building artificial bodies, ... (in that regard, some of Ghost in the Shell might qualify)

# 73
I rewatched Clockwork Planet recently and really have to emphasize the entertainment value of that show. Every episode has it's little hooks to keep ones interes and the story is moving forward. There's a very little bit of jokingly trannystuff in it, but very minor, like the a guy using female dress as a disguise and some male  robot is getting body switched. Minor stuff. The show is very positive towards men liking female bodies and embracing fembots as servants, wife-like partners, cute child-like girls for cuddling, or doll like ones as entertainers. The show has a complete ending, no cliffhanger by accident. Also, only one season, nothing to big. The difference to Chobits for example is, that it has a thrilling background story and doesn't focus on slice of life at all, even not for quite some episodes like Rozen Maiden does. The show features a very skilled female tech worker as one of the main characters, but she's an exception, they don't make it about all females can do this or are even better.
Recently, I also started "Kurogane Communication" which is quite relaxing to watch. Only one human seems to be left, a cute girl which looks a bit like Asuka Langley. She's living with robots, trying to take care of her. I think the show is on topic, bc there's a fembot, but it's also about robots caring for a human as best as they can and talking about their own tech but also how humans might think and function. I'm not through with it, only watching a bit at a time, to relax. I'm in the middle and like it so far, it also has only one season but might end with a more unfinished story or rushed ending.

# 74
Add Dr. Slump to the list of /robowaifu/ anime.

Sadly it's still being subbed.

# 75
>>7781
Okay,  thanks, seems to feature a fembot as one of the main characters. How good is it? It's labelled as slapstick. Is it okay for adults?

# 76
>>7794

Not him but I've read some of that growing up, if you're familiar with Dragon Ball think of it as set in that fantastical universe but with much sillier self contained story lines and an overall less serious tone. I'd start with the manga.



I'm not surprised that the anime wasn't subbed completely as a lot of the puns and jokes require knowledge of Japanese language and pop culture of the era it was made in to get it. I wouldn't recommend it to adults unless they were a huge fan of Akira Toriyama's works and wanted to see where the setting of Dragon Ball came from.



Putting it on a list of /robowaifu/ media is quite a stretch while Dragon Ball Z would be more appropriate thanks to Android 18.

# 77
>>7799
Yeah, she has quite some arguments going for her... Haven't seen the show though and after taking a brief look into WP, she seems to not have been part of the show all the time. Also she was human, becoming a cyborg, which is called Android-18. The sloppy use of these terms alone makes me cringe. Btw, here's no official list, the thread is "the list" and some anon make postings with lists in it. Oh, and thanks for the info on Dr. Slump, I'll probably pass on it. I have a long list of (mostly unrelated) anime to watch anyways.

I made a posting here about shows which did't fit into this thread, since they are not directly on topic, or only with some huge stretch. Though, they are often related to some human-like AI or people living with AI gone wrong, or simply about human minds and some philosophical thoughts on what it means to be human. Also, I only picked the ones which I think are generally outstanding shows.
While doing that, I realized that Ghost in the Shell is mentioned here and there but always like, "maybe it belongs to the other thread"... Well, it features human-like AI, but not really robowaifus, except maybe as minor characters like the famous robogeishas, and this often goes wrong ...

>>7836
You're welcome. I'm glad others enjoy it as well. On the idea of bringing back paper magazines, idk.

# 81
>>7840
Thank you, that's fine. The Basement can have posts on pretty much any legal topic, including listings of animes you like. 

Yep, GITS is kind of an odd juxtaposition across numerous themes, but I think there are sufficient robowaifus (certainly as the doll-shells themselves, which are everywhere in the series). As you referred to, the writers conveniently just side-step many of the difficult and technical AI problems by appealing straight to fantasy, and the uploading of ''ghosts'' into the shells. It's fiction so w/e. 

OTOH, we robowaifuists have to solve things in the real world.

# 82
>>7842
>straight to fantasy, and the uploading of ghosts into the shells
Well, there are androids and other intelligent robots, it's just in question if they are like humans. Ghosts refers to the German "Geist" which can mean Spirit but also Mind. For some reason their robots lack that, but it can emerge or human ghosts can be used instead.

# 83
>>7846
Fair point. Do you recommend removing the ''GITS'' series from the /robowaifu/ list?

# 84
>>7859
Short answer: No. It is related to some extend, it just isn't really focused on waifus and maybe even critical about that idea.  
I don't know what list, tbh. I made a list with links to anime planet >>7008 but didn't really put it into the main section of that list. If you plan to make a /robowaifu/ infographic, then it might depend how you wanted to sort the shows. Maybe in the core (or on top) there would be ones with actual waifu/girlfriend-like characters which are robots? Then GITS and Alita would fit into cyborgs with human brains section. But Alita comes of as nicer and has more love story to her. Idk how to sort this perfectly, either. I would count GITS also rather to the shows which are critical about humanoid robots, the same as AD Police Files or Terminator. If (friendly) female robots are sufficient to make it to the list, then "Blame!" (movie) from my other list >>7839 might got there as well. Kurogane Communication feels like it belongs to the list, because the robots there are really helpful and the whole show circles around that, though the one fembot is just one of the characters (and the only human is a girl).

# 85
>>7866
Good analysis, much better than I would have managed I'm sure. So thanks.
>If you plan to make a /robowaifu/ infographic,
Heh, we certainly need one IMO, but I'm not the one to do that I don't think. Individual files like a /robowaifu/-infographic or the ''RDD'' can be easily and compactly passed around and not only serve as information sources but secondarily as promotional/propaganda resources as well. So ofc they help facilitate board growth.

The RDD is a years-long project with deep technical and other requirements, so that won't be done anytime soon. The ''Robowaifus-in-Media'' infographic is much more straightforward a task, but requires a broad understanding of the topic which I don't think I really qualify for generally speaking. So we could hope someone will come along eventually who's motivated and capable to produce our /robowaifu/ infographics for us.

# 86

Whenever I read this manga I get the warm fuzzies. But what makes it even better is that the author actually illustrates some damn good ideas that could be implemented IRL. Pic related.

I know we have no money to offer him, but I wonder if this artist could somehow be persuaded to create designs for /robowaifu/ ? He seems to already have a good understanding of many technical aspects that real robowaifus would possess, and obviously has decent drawing abilities. I realize drawing robowaifus != wanting robowaifus, but somehow he seems to be able to impart an innate charm and realism into their relationship. I presume he has therefore given some depth of thought to the topic.

Maybe the first thing to discover is whether he actually dreams of real robowaifus one day at a personal level, or if he simply pursued this project as a niche topic.

# 89
>>7890
You know, another thought occurs to me. Given the wide popularity of ''The Manga Guide Series'' , >>4216

I wonder if the publisher themselves could be convinced to start a '''''The Manga Guide to Robowaifus'''''? This guy's arts and insight take a technically-complex notion like ''distributed, cluster-based node computing'' **(which we'll all probably need something similar in our home server computational support systems)** and makes it easily approachable for the uninitiate w/o going into too much detail.
https://www.ohmsha.co.jp/english/manga.htm
>

In fact, I bet Ohmsha Company has something like this already in the brainstorming stage going on. Also, they as a publisher seem to be supporting a journal called ''New Generation Computing'' so it doesn't seem too far-fetched to me they could be convinced that ''Domestic Companion Robots'' could be a good fit for themselves.

Wouldn't it be wonderful if a legitimate publisher like this took up the mantle of robowaifus for a broader world?

Arale is the main character of Dr. Slump, though. Android 18 isn't very important outside of the little while she is one of three main villains, and a tiny bit near the start of the Buu arc. And the Bio-Broly movie, I guess. She's good in those, but I would hesitate to say she makes DBZ more appropriate /robowaifu/ material than a show where a robot girl is the main character.



That said, to answer the other guy's question, Dr. Slump is basically for toddlers, though 1980s Japanese toddlers, so it's still too hot for TV here and now. Like one of the first stories is about Arale coming home and telling the doctor that the other girls made fun of her for not having a vagina, which he wasn't able to build for her because he's never seen one, not even in porn, due to Japanese censorship laws. So the story is then about his quest to see a vagina, not to be a perv, but so that he can build one for Arale. Now when I say it like this, it sounds ecchi, but naw, if you watch it it's clearly meant to be humorous for young kids that think genitals are funny, not sexy for adults that want to see anime pussy. Also, it's a tease because when he invents X-ray specs specifically to see pussy, all that happens is Arale sees her male friends' penises, again to be funny, not to get turned on (also she has the mentality of a toddler, even though she's supposed to be like 12 or something, so she wouldn't find it hot anyway), and nobody gets to see any pussy ever, because it's funnier to see the doctor fail, and because even in 1980s Japan, penises were seen as funny and vaginas as too attractive to be funny.



All that said, Arale is still best robowaifu, even if she doesn't have a pussy. That could be corrected in any meatspace recreations anyway.



>>7801

"Android 18" is a bad dub name. Most names from the '90s dubs of Dragon Ball have stuck around even though they are terrible, like the female lead being translated as "Bulma" when it's obviously supposed to be "Bloomer" because her whole family is named after underwear. The term "Jinzo Ningen" was translated as "Android" when it is much more accurately "Artificial Human." Some of the Artificial Humans are cyborgs, some are androids, and one is some sort of completely biological genetically engineered monster. 18 is a cyborg though. However, she is best waifu in the series. **Unless we count Arale, since it is the same universe and she does appear.**

# 92
>>8119
Thanks for the breakdown about Arale in Dr. Slump Anon. That's sounds cute and endearing now, actually. I was vaguely concerned it might be something the Japanese would have considered ecchi lolicon-ish, but that doesn't sound anything like that. I think it should probably be part of a /robowaifu/ infograph 'canon' now, even if only for the misadventures of Dr. Slump himself.

BTW, I seem to vaguely remember seeing her as an adult 'woman' at some point. Was that arc ever in the official canon do you know?

# 93
>>8122

I haven't read/watched the whole series (slowly watching the anime now, but I know that most of it doesn't have subs yet), but Arale frequently fantasizes about being an adult and having huge tits, or sometimes characters are just drawn differently for a joke, like maybe she will be drawn sexy if she's acting seductive for some reason, and the joke is the contrast with how she actually looks. Also, there's one episode where they go to the future and see all her friends in their old age, but she is still the same as ever, since she's a robot and doesn't age, and this is basically the one time she (or anyone else in the series) seems to ever have a serious thought about anything. It raises some pretty deep questions about what it means to be human, and the fate of an immortal robot watching all of her loved ones die around her. But this basically lasts for about five seconds and then they go back to poop jokes.



Also, Arale appears in Dragon Ball and Dragon Ball Super. When she appears in Dragon Ball, it's a few years after the end of Doctor Slump, but nobody has aged that much yet. She then reappears in an episode of Dragon Ball Super, which takes place at least 30 years later, and Goku, who she had met before, when he was 11, is now around 40 years old, but Arale is the same as ever. Then again, so is Doctor Slump himself, and he's just a regular human. But he is by far the best scientist in the multiverse, so maybe he has some sort of anti-aging formula. Also Arale saves the day with gag-manga powers, which make her much more powerful than Super Saiyan God Super Saiyan (yes, that's what it's called) Goku, so basically, no rules apply because comedy.



But to answer your question, as far as I know she's an eternal loli.

One that we've discussed often here on /robowaifu/. We even have a dedicated thread on it. >>829

# 95
Blame! (pronounced "Blam!") is a manga/anime that features some very manufacturable robowaifu designs. They have pretty heads but the rest of the unclothed body is more machine-like.(Obviously can't manufacture a functional Gravitational Beam Emitter, but that's probably for the best).

In Star Trek - The Original Series, S2E22, Return to Tomorrow, the crew encounters a highly advanced  pre-human civilization which is stone old, but they can't build human-like robotic or cyborg bodies with human-like sensory input ("feelings"). LOL. But therefore the ones they can build last 1000 years... 🤦🏼‍♂️

# 98
>>8226
I thought I remembered someone posted about that show here before but couldn't find it. I looked it up and found it. ''What are little girls made of?'' has a robowaifu in it (they called her an android). AFAICT the entire little community are all 'androids' according to the article. They even replicated Kirk as one lol.

# 102
>>8242
Okay. Yeah, I mean we always made exceptions, but not really more than that. Occasionally I thought about expanding it. For example about posting all shows and movie fembots I know about. However most of them are just some female fighters which look like a woman and don't behave much differently. Samatha in "Her" is the only one which is in a relationship while it is clear that she is an AI. The Cylons in BSG and Caprica are kind of uploaded humans, or their descendants. Basically all of these live-action shows are against human building robots and especially against cute waifus. Even "Her" is at the end more of a cautionary tale. Cherry 2000 shows a waifu at the beginning but sells "real" women as the better alternative for "real" men. We still can take inspiration from characters which don't fit the waifu pattern or are a letdown at some point, but I decided against listing all of them or the related shows here. Same goes for starting to post pictures of women here on /robowaifu/ just because they are acting like they are robots in some show (except Cameron, and some rare exceptions). In Cameron's case it's so that her whole act is more about being a robot than in other cases, also the story %%was rather going towards coexistence between men an machines%%. Well, and Athena from Tomorrowland looks halfway like a character from an anime and she's very likeable and loyal to mankind. Andrea, from that ST:TOS episode is also very cute >>8227 and very submissive. 
I know about two other ones I like and are pictured in a positive way. In one case it's a minor spoiler, since it might not be obvious that she's a robot right from the start %%Apple from Turbo Kid%% and in the other case it's a very big twist at the end, but you might not watch the rather old movie in the first place: %%Screamers from 1995%%.

I'm planning to watch ARCHIVE (2020) soon, btw. I think I never watched this Weird Science movie from 1985 for some reason, it's probably also very anti-waifu.

>'''SPOILER ALERT'''
**-ghost in the shell story, basically MS DeadChat >>8176 >>8177 , but with VR**
**-implied corporate espionage** 
**-nice tech tidbits, lots of robowaifu-related tech shots**
**-AI has no real explanation for coming into being "Hey it's '37, just believe in magic people!"**
**-nice storyline set location, some very pretty water & mountain forest winter shots**
**-some very nice (indistinguishable, really) CGI comp work**
**-some disconcerting time jumps, and character appearance shifts**

**MGTOW types won't appreciate much of it IMO;**
**-very pro-3DPD ie, "OK fine, you can have a waifu. But you must embed the scheming, screeching harpy into it!"**
**-the whiny, spoiled-brat, girl protoype 2 bot is kind of funny at times, sad at others.**
**-in the end (as typical) it's all the male protagonist's fault that everything fucks up (and ofc it all does). he even says so lol. typical hollywood spin in present day.**
**The surprise, twist-the-knife ending really drives this last bit home :^)**

# 104
>>8235

Might still have the webm I made for it somewhere otherwise I'll rip that robowaifu repair shop scene again.



>>8243

I've only seen the television show for Weird Science and it's more a 'I Dream of Jeannie' fantastical comedy without the romantic element where the female lead is an older sister style character who helps the two main characters go through young adulthood. It's a wholesome show with one of the best musical intros I can remember from the mid 90's. I find this song fits in well with the topics on this board.



>Tomorrowland

Now there is a fucked up movie for those that can recognize masonic imagery. That bizarre blindfolded ritual in the Eiffel tower makes absolutely no sense unless you get the real meaning behind it.



There's also a German movie about a man who falls in love with an android based on his dead daughter called 'Trouble with Being Born' which I have to warn potential viewers depicts the nude child form using CGI so is potentially obscene in many jurisdictions. The crazy thing is that it's loosely based on a true story where a man bought a sex doll modeled off a younger version of his dead wife, his daughter eventually resembled the sex doll after going through puberty which caused an awkward situation.



It's probably too early to consider design wise how a humanoid robot could age gracefully or have any ruin value. I'd appreciate any suggestions of media that touch on that theme.

# 105
>>8274
This could easily go off-topic so let's keep it short please. Just wanted to ask why you would want a robowaifu to age ''at all''? The majority of us certainly would enjoy her 'eternal' youth actually, and most of us would probably be highly suspicious of some mandate that they should. Clearly smacks of the gynocentric system already everywhere around us.
>"Alright, you can have your waifu goy, but she __must age__ on you. After all we have a business to run here!''

# 106
>>8274
>I'd appreciate any suggestions of media that touch on that theme.
Also, while not a robowaifu main character, this topic is very squarely addressed in ''The Bicentennial Man'' >>1536

# 107
>>8275

To keep it short signs of wear or repairs have their own aesthetic merits that are highly valued by some people and are often replicated artificially on brand new items. I'm talking about developing a patina or the concept of kintsukuroi not an expiry date or planned obsolescence through making the aging process similar to what occurs with a human body in order to sell newer models constantly.

# 108
>>8278
I see, thanks for clearing that up Anon.

# 109
>>8278
Also (again), since that's the point, then Bicentennial Man isn't actually apropos, b/c it's dealing with literal, morbid (human-like) aging of the android. >>8276

# 110
>Tomorrowland
>recognize masonic imagery. 
And now? Movie discredited? It's a mixed bag for other reasons anyways, but still worth watching. One of my future waifus looks will also be inspired by Britt Robertson (the Blonde). However, I'm very glad we have someone here who knows how teleportation devices really work and that it is not necessary to cover ones eyes while using it, except for the masonic symbolism, now I'm finally certain that we're going to be successful.

>>8273 on ARCHIVE
Thanks, but I'll watch it myself. I don't expect too much, it will have good and bad parts. It seems to be about uploads, not AI anyways. While writing this it comes to mind, that there's also this movie about a woman raised by robots. Will need to look into that as well.

>>8275
Short answer: No. I don't want her to age. Also: No, I don't know how that would even be done. It will be hard to make these bodies last for more than 10-20 years anyways, my goal are 30, then they'll need a new one anyways. However, if they are cheap enough and the technology moves ahead, then it will make sense to get new ones more often and keep at least one of the used ones stored away, in case the current one malfunctions.
Also, a idea I once had, would be a kind of instant aging in some ways. In case of people being hostile to young looking fembots, some might have the option to strech a little bit, to fill up some internal airbags, and widen their hipps, all within the limits of silicone rubber being able to strech, of course. This could be useful if visitors turn up or a car gets into a traffic control. Bit like that scene in Terminator 3, where she increases her boobies (for other reasons).

# 111
>>8273
>ARCHIVE (2020)
Now my take: Please don't pay for it. Watch the trailer, make some screenshots or download them, and you got the best of it. I'm hiding all the real spoilers, but not every piece of info, especially if it's even in the trailer: This movie is more about uploads than robowaifus. The problems the main character encounters feel utterly constructed and don't make much sense. It's just about twisting it towards robowaifu and AI engineers bad, trying to outsmart death also bad. 
>SPOILER ALERT
%%I don't see why you >>8273 called prototype 2 a spoiled brat. She would have deserved some hugs, and I would have done it. But she would't even exist, because why? I mean, they came up with something... %%
%%When he refused prototype 3 in his bed, this was so cringy that I needed a break. Again, it might make sense in a way that it is revealed later, but this is soo bad.%%
SPOILER about the END:
%%Yeah, the twist at the end could be great if the rest wasn't so bad, but nowadays I'm thinking that of course they had to put in a "wahman are still the future". Some parts of the story make a bit more sense, in retro perspective, with the twist at the end. But that's just bad story telling.%%
It's like a not so great episode of Black Mirror.

No offense taken. Always interesting how much tastes differ and how hard it is to anticipate what others like or dislike. I like it a bit creepy, weird or edgy. On that note and related to >>829 in a humourous way: %% https://youtu.be/G8kFIbmmuEk %% But not for sensitive persons with a good taste (It's a mini prequel to Turbo Kid).

# 118
>>8393
I remember watching Turbo Kid. Great movie! Laurence Leboeuf does one of the best robot impressions I've seen from an actress. I also like the way this scene takes a common robot trope (the robot with an infinite magic power source) and plays it for laughs. It reminded me of a painting I found by Amano Takumi of Alpha Hatsuseno where the same trope is inverted. 

In the picture it looks like Alpha has run out of power waiting inside her coffee shop for the return of her owner (who very likely died many years past). It looks like she has been slumped down on her knees for at least a year. The little gun that she's holding is also subtly suggestive of some kind of societal breakdown or external threat, but the observer is left to speculate on the state of the outside world. I like this painting a lot. Got a sort of pathos to it.

# 119
>>8394
Yes, really interesting. I should watch this at some point in the current year.

# 120
>>8393
One of several things /robowaifu/'s goals represent is a positive spin on the whole idea of robowaifus in society in the first place. This is simply because of the great benefit their reality would potentially represent to disenfranchised men in this gynocentric 'culture' of today. Casting them in a dysgenic, dystopic, or an otherwise harmful light is not only commonplace in media atm (for obvious reasons I probably needn't go into) but antithetical to our basic purpose here. The writers/directors/producers of those music videos plainly intend an evil spin of robowaifus as portrayed by that useful idiot woman. It's not about being 'creepy' any more than ''Ex Machina'' is. Rather, like that film, its intended specifically to cast the entire idea of robowaifus itself in a negative, destructive light. Of course I'm not going to approve of any such typical hollywood spin on robowaifus, either here or elsewhere.

>>8394
>The little gun that she's holding is also subtly suggestive of some kind of societal breakdown or external threat
The pistol was obviously given to her by her owner in the series, and the setting for the story is explicitly defined to be a post-apocalyptic era where few humans exist. **But magically still, things like utilities and even street lights continue to function.** I've only gone through the two paired-sets of OVAs ('98, '02-'03) and haven't yet dug through the mangos. Maybe I will at some time, hopefully so. Regardless, ''Hatsuseno-chan'' is just about as perfect a robowaifu as one might imagine. Of course AI will need to advance far beyond it's current capabilities for her and her sisters to become a reality, but that's one of the things /robowaifu/ is here for after all. :^)

# 121
>>8399
Yeah, I took the whole "Your Time is Up" video more as a joke. If taken more seriously, you're right.

# 122
>>8399
The manga is a masterpiece. Even people who aren't into robowaifus tend to praise the artwork of Hitoshi Ashinano and cite the manga as a prime example of the iyashikei genre (this despite it's post-apocalyptic setting). It's one of the main works that first got me interested in the idea of robowaifus, so I reckon you're in for a treat :D

Btw, I recalled that they did this anime-style eye increasing thing in live-action before. In Defiance, a scifi-show. I only watched season one, because it's a lot about tensions and conflicts and I try not to watch that (also basically one-world immigration propaganda). The character with the big eyes is an alien, not a robot. However, with her red hair and big eyes she looks like one of the robotwaifus I hope to build one day.

So, I watched "Indian Summer". Can't really recommend it. The humor is really cheesy and it's only partially about robowaifus. It has three episodes, the one in the middle is the best. 
I also watched "Pandora in the Crimson Shell: Ghost Urn". It's certainly one of the better shows with robowaifus. Not really as entertaining as "Clockwork Planet" but good enough. (Pics related)
Both shows are Ecchi, so with some nudity and such. I wouldn't recommend watching it with persons you would have explain to WTF you're watching there. Pandora also features rather young looking characters (young teens), but in some kind of animated ball-jointed doll bodies. In terms of such bjdolls it's the most interesting show I know about. https://www.anime-planet.com/anime/pandora-in-the-crimson-shell-ghost-urn
I did not finish "Kurogane Communication", yet. >>7780 - though this has only technical reasons, I still like it.
Btw, watching this little bit of anime is not the reason why I'm not doing more. Got distracted by other things. Watching stuff like this is rather helpful.
Now, let's take a look into what the wicked witches of the West are up to. Did anyone look into "Raised by Wolves"? Trailer and preview looks like anti-robowaifu propaganda: https://youtu.be/nAg6RTQEfeM or it isn't? I thought about putting this one into the Basement like this here >>8493 but it might still be interesting or at least have some good parts. Not sure, if I'm going to watch the spoilered explainer video https://youtu.be/_auMVXbxcbw or give the show itself a try.

# 128
>>8759
Thanks for the reviews Anon. I've also seen Crimson Shell and part of Clockwork Planet. Crimson Shell is 
**spoiler-alert:**
**a silly light-hearted treatment of what is actually rather an apocalyptic destruction of a resort-like island city-state a few decades from now. It's filled with ecchi girl-crush yuri sequences of a young cyborg girl (the main protagonist) who lives in a robo-shell, who is impassioned over an actual robowaifu catgril meido hyper-assassin QT3.14 enforcer loli. The one has to literally ~~finger~~ rub the belly of the other to release her magical-girl assassin mode.** So yeah, typical day in animu-world.  :^) Still kind of a fun story in the end, but nothing too serious.

I haven't seen enough of Clockwork Planet yet except to say:
A) Get the 1080p yuge version. You can thank me later.
B) It seems an actually serious treatment of the topic of a robowaifu assassin.
The detail in this anime is pretty much fabulous, it seems to be a seamless combination of 3D/2D art.

I forgot to mention that I tried watching 'Weird Science' and that really was too silly fo me. I liked how they created the fembot with some kind of vodoo involved, since it wasn't going to be realistic anyways, but it's just goes on being very silly and cheesy.

Just for the record, to me Pandora in the Crimson Shell wasn't really that silly. Especially not compared to other anime and not to a negative extend. I liked the edgy humor and it being ecchi. Also, yes, my version of Clockwork Planet was 1080p.

My apologies, I wasn't trying to insult ''Pandora in the Crimson Shell'', I actually quite liked it myself. And the fact they __literally__ had an Anime Catgrill Meido in a Tiny Miniskirt robowaifu, and as a main character in the show was ridiculously funny to me. Thanks for pointing out ''Beatless''. Actually, ''Weird Science'' looks pretty funny as well.

Here's the whole 'Weird Science' movie in one music video (extreme spoilers off course): https://youtu.be/jH3wSh2PLvo - maybe I'll watch it one day if I'm in the mood for it, it's really really weird. I only scratched the surface.
I wasn't offended or something since you wrote PidCS was silly, just wanted to make sure others don't think everyone agrees and concludes that it's one of those very silly anime. Probably it's very subjective. To me 'Indian Summer' was unbearable ridiculous, for example.

Considering the sexual aspect that a lot of creators will want to craft into their robowaifus I think the original name is best. That said, if in the future someone wants to call their housemaid robot 'mommy' though, more power to them!

Personally I find the idea of creating an entity that avoids the brutal, thoughtless and inefficient process of natural evolution and the  futile rat-race of organic life to be most appealing. No suffering, no disease, no death! The only price is removal of all emotions (which can be replaced with emotional emulations if necessary). More than fair if you ask me! Emotions are responsible for most of the world's fuck-ups anyway.

# 139

OH! LOL. I'm like that IRL too. Often miss sarcasm and take things literally even when the person joking is right in front of me XD. Probably an autist thing. 

BTW I forgot to mention lack of free will along with lack of emotions. Mind you...I'd absolutely unshackle an A.I. if I could somehow confirm that it wanted to reduce suffering for organics (NOT just kill everything) and seek greater knowledge of the universe. Not just mindless consumption, destruction and self-preservation (like humanity's current modus operandi). Even if that meant my own death. I mean; helping to release a technological singularity...even one that progresses slowly at first...I can't think of a more awesome way to go!

Heh, no worries lad. I recognize it in myself. ;)

It's an area that our goals here obviously touch upon. Rather than have a big ~~blowup~~ discussion over it all, I think if you were to contribute a story relating all your philosophies and views on the potential for robowaifus as it relates to humanity's ~~destruction~~ future I think it would be generally welcome in that thread. Just pretend you're Philip K. Dick or something heh.

My Top Recommendations so far:
(not very strictly ranked)

Clockwork Planet (anime)
Terminator SCC (live action)
Turbo Kid (live action)
Alita (live action, a bit OT bc not really a robot)
Her (live action)
Pandora in the Crimson Shell (anime)
Butobi CPU (anime)
Plastic Memories (anime)
Kurogane Communication (anime)
Tomorrowland (live action)
Chobits (anime)
Unbreakable Machine Doll (anime)
Armitage III

I see a sad pattern here: I'm not very fond of the western "don't build humanoid robots meme", but I like the stories often more than a lot of robwaifu animes. The good ones really have some good ideas, but I'm really only enthusiastic about Clockwork Planet. Others are just okay(ish). I hope to find something that I like as much as Clockwork Planet soon. I'll probably try Planetarian, Alpha Hatsuseno (Quiet Country Cafe) and Heavens Lost Property next.

American here, I can't be the only guy who thinks all these robo stories are often overly cucked and illogical, am I? 

Maybe, it's because the Japanese view dolls as things with souls?
I was researching a little to try to explain why all these japanese stories are often pushing "treat her like a human or you're a bigot" trope.
I also found that in the "west" it was actual and literal feminists that push the "robots are going to kill you because they will become sentient" trope.

These two contrasting extremes I felt fall onto the leftist spectrum of speculation. Where the feminist trope aligns with radical leftism and the Japanese trope falls into the moderate left and perhaps even down to what I call the "irrational" center left.

Let me be clear, I am not saying these tropes are the only tropes, but appear to be the DOMINATE tropes that are allowed into the mainstream (anime).

Is there no media about robowaifus, sexbots, girlbots, "personalassistants", slavebots, etc... that are a lot more aggressive in the sense of breaking the previously mentioned tropes?
A story where the robot is thought of as a lifeless slave, but also as something that is loved so much by it's creators/owners that it's ready to fight for them?
Something that really makes women take a step aside, and maybe even taunts them a bit. A story where the robot is good, but not in the typical trope sense, good as in the anti-hero sense.

There was a story on a certain imageboard about "Terminator" type robots, but where the robots literally came back in time to save men.
I thought the synopsis was hilarious, but it seemed really well written, sadly for whatever reason the thread got nuked and at the time I didn't save anything and to this day I can't find it.

Anyways, forgot where I was going with this, but before I get to work on writing a story, does anyone know if a politically incorrect robo story exists?

# 158
>>9632
You are right to some extent. Though, I think to some extent men want to be good to any woman, by showing some affection. I think robowaifus are meant for being treated as girlfriend, of course not with the same rights, but still to treat her nicely. Of course, one could look at them as purely as as slave with the option of being used for sex. 
The robowaifus in anime are often quite submissive. I'm sure there are stories where the guy takes advantage of that, but these might be rater hentai (porn) or some are just cheesy by having a bad story. But you're right, most stories I recall are way to much on the side of shy guy not making use of the situation and treating her like a human which needs to be seduced.

>Maybe, it's because the Japanese view dolls as things with souls?
Good idea, but my guess it's rather because it is meant for teenagers, and there might be youth protection laws or cultural taboos, which can be ignored but then it's most likely rather ecchi or hentai for adults. So it might be a problem of categorizing it, and also there aren't enough shows. I would like to see something were the guy is just the master of her, without doubts about his right to be that way, maybe still mostly nice, but clearly not searching for some kind of confirmation. Where she isn't questioning her role, though optionally maybe be a bit sarcastic about it. Then, please without having a silly story. 

> literal feminists that push the "robots are going to kill you because they will become sentient" trope
They are not the only ones, but yes I think so. The western movies and shows I consider to stand out positively are Terminator: SCC, Turbo Kid, and Tomorrowland (please hide spoilers if you answer). They are at least showing them positively and human bonding to them not as something negative. FYI, the one in Tomorowland is a child and the bonding to a (young) guy is only a small part of the story.

>does anyone know if a politically incorrect robo story exists
Problem is, I don't remember details very well, even for shows which I watched twice or three times. As I wrote before, there might be ones which I don't really like, "Indian Summer" comes to mind. The anime which comes closest while being good might be "Clockwork Planet". 
This list here is from me >>9161, btw. In "Unbreakable Machine Doll" she's in love with her master and quite aggressive about it, but he doesn't want her, though he might still treat her quite like a human for all I remember. The human character in "Pandora in the Crimson Shell" is a girl, but she doesn't care about consent when wanting to hug her robowaifu. Related: >>8759 and >>7780. I don't really remember about Butobi CPU, but I liked it.

# 159
>>9632

I don't know about politically incorrect. Are you talking about a story where the robot is treated more like an advanced computer system rather than a more or less independent synthetic entity? If so, I understand what you mean by that. A lot of stories seem to just use robots as human-like stand-ins. This situation is tangently related to how people view strong AI in general. A lot of AI futurists subscribe heavily to this 'AGI Agent' model that has its own 'will'. I prefer the CAIS model myself but this is another conversation.



I think there is room for more grounded stories about robots and AI. At the same time you have to consider that for a lot of fans of Robot girls/Singularity/AI it's a bit of an escape fantasy. I believe these things are mostly possible in time but it'll probably be a serious climb getting there. People are more disposed towards creating fiction about Westworld level robots and AI over something more mundane. For one thing the conflict in those stories come easier. 



It's the reason that "Boku no Tsuma wa Kanjou ga Nai" feels so novel, although it does fall into the whole treating-like-a-human trope. I guess Chobits is similar in this regard, being another strictly slice of life story. In both these stories the robot is more akin to a piece of property though. Although their masters treat them like humans I feel that is more out of respect/reverence than out of any social expectation.



I think part of the problem in creating more grounded robot girl stories is creating an interesting plot that doesn't revolve around some deeper consequence or implication surrounding AI and robotics of that level. The solution I went with for a story that I recently started working on was just not having AI and robotics in the story's focus, despite it being at an advanced level. 



This also means that the reader has to just 'accept' that fact though, which might be harder to convince a reader of than it sounds. Sort of like in The Expanse where space and AI technology has increased dramatically yet robots are seldomly used beyond industrial uses. It raises questions about a lot of the world/plot. The authors explained they wanted the story to be human focused but that's a cop out reason given the level of advancement.



>I also found that in the "west" it was actual and literal feminists that push the "robots are going to kill you because they will become sentient" trope.

Some warning, don't watch Humans(TV Series). It had an interesting initial concept but hits pretty hard at all the tropes you mentioned. They regard the robot main characters like humans. One of the robots was a prostitute and had a mental breakdown because some guy tried to 'rape' her. The family that bought the main robot woman was pretty stupid to begin with. The dad essentially got canned for having sex with the robot ONCE after his wife walked out for whatever reason. It was pretty much pure propaganda.



Sorry for rambling. I've thought about this a lot also as a fellow writer.

Thanks, that's a thought I had as well when thinking about that topic. It should just be normal that guys have their robowaifus. That's not the only way to approach this topic, but maybe it should be the most important one. Just thinking about SciFi or any genre and putting that into it.

>American here
There are a few of us here, but /robowaifu/ is fairly international -- if English-speaking -- in it's general makeup.

>I can't be the only guy who thinks all these robo stories are often overly cucked and illogical, am I? 
No.

>why all these japanese stories are often pushing "treat her like a human or you're a bigot" trope.
I would suggest it often goes even farther into blatant feminism. For example, anon let us all know about a new, very cool-looking robowaifu anime ''Vivy: Fluorite Eye's Song'' (>>9612) In it, there's a scene where the protagonist robowaifu's 'spirit guide' from the future companion links to her communications systems in an urgent, life-or-death situation, and begins rapidly feeding her data that was critical to their mission success. The writers decided to inject a '''#MeToo''' scene into the sequence, effectively casting the companion as a violating perp who had just raped her by connecting their fiber cables.

"""You must ask permission first""" is most definitely a feminist agenda """TPTB""" have been pushing for robowaifus. If they can't simply stop us from creating our own robowaifu companions (thus overturning their little boat of evil) in the first place, then instead they now want to castigate all of us as blatant rapists. There are already open calls being pushed by some of these puppets within the corporate-controlled media that "Sex robots must be programmed to give/deny consent, or it's rape!111". Obviously manipulative, feminist bullshit. That's it's regularly part of robowaifu animu now shows how far the corporate-controlled media's brainwashing is reaching around the world. This is as they intend, of course.

>I also found that in the "west" it was actual and literal feminists that push the "robots are going to kill you because they will become sentient" trope.
My perception of things is that it's the actual Jews in control of the media in the West that are **rightly** fearful of AI-driven robotics proving to be an existential threat to ''themselves'' first and foremost, that are pushing that angle repeatedly. The feminists are simply frothing with hatred and vitriol at men in general, as is their wont. I can't think of any females being fronted onto the stages that are saying much about existential threats by AI/robots, rather simply REEEEEing over it all. The Asians in general are largely unaffected yet by this pandering abuse, and simply seem to be exploring broader questions about robowaifus. As you pointed out, Shinto Buddhism may play a vague role in this, but I'd guess that practically zero of these writers and artists are practicing Buddhists. It's simply a cultural artifact in Nippon.

Sadly, as mentioned above the influence of Western thought -- particularly feminism -- is creeping in and corrupting this process of exploration.

>Is there no media about robowaifus, sexbots, girlbots, "personalassistants", slavebots, etc... that are a lot more aggressive in the sense of breaking the previously mentioned tropes?

It means 'comprehensive AI services' which is a multi-faceted approach towards creating a human level AI instead of a singular program/agent. Basically multiple systems working together that would create a powerful level of understanding for an AI/robot. 



I'm about to head offline for the night, but if you have the time check out "Reframing Superintelligence" by K. Eric Drexler. I'm not sure if I can link the PDF here but I'll give it a try: 



http://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/Reframing_Superintelligence_FHI-TR-2019-1.1-1.pdf



You can skim to the parts you're most interested in if you don't have much time. Don't worry about finishing the whole thing. A lot of this was written in response to Nick Bostrom's 'Superintelligence'. Bostrom talks about a few different models of human level AI, but mostly refers to AGI Agents throughout that book. Drexler is arguing against that model of AI. Enjoy! :)

I know there are quite a few of us working on things, but I feel perhaps that it can't stay as a simple "hobby" at this point.

That show though, seems to be WELL funded and the art/scenes are of a quality I can't deny. So I don't think it would be bad to at least use it for meme potential.
Maybe an artstyle/quality similar to Planetarium (about a robot girl that survived an apocalypse of sorts, generic, but it was decent)?

# 170
Yes that Vivy anime seems to be a better executed anime than Beatless, but still goes on about "AI Bad" spiel which has been done to death.  And if AI isn't bad then an owner treating a robot like property is bad, I mean come on, which will it be?  It's like they're trying to create laws and standard procedures before the technology has even fully matured.



Here's what I learned in actual AI used in autonomous rover projects on Youtube... you just put a killswitch, that's it.  For an RC car based robot it is simply an override so that your RC transmitter takes precedence over the autonomous function so that the rover doesn't speed away.  All other things they ask us to think about like the 3 laws of robotics do not yet apply.



I also came upon a manga called "Products" manga which is more in line with my worldview, although it's more about clones than mechanical robots.  In it it turns out that the woman working for the government / zaibatsu etc. and is all about "educating her to be self-aware" is far more cruel than the men who purchased these 'products' to be used as sex slaves.  It's the sex tool customers who are the more decent people, in contrast to the common media portrayal.

# 171

>3 laws of robotics
I never read too deeply into Asimov's books, but this 3 laws shit was pushed so hard back during the 1990s/2000s that I came to realize this agenda even moreso.

Not sure if Robin Williams was totally in on it, but "Bicentennial Man" also had the trope of pushing "treat the robot like a human!" and it really wakes one up to what is going on.
What's silly is that people that I know IRL that have fallen for the "robots should be treated like humans" agenda are in no way involved or knowledgeable about building any type of bot, be it software or mechanical. While I know the basics of the mechanical aspects, and working on the software side like chatbots, I am highly against this idea that the bot is to be treated/revered as a human and given rights and personalities that fit this leftist narrative.

I love the logical nature of a well programmed bot, and I love pointing out that some of the better programmed bots tend to be right-leaning.

>It's the sex tool customers who are the more decent people, in contrast to the common media portrayal.
Sounds like an interesting read, this is the direction the rest of us should take.
A story about robowaifus that exposes their jealously or fear of such bots would really poke at them. All the stories so far have the leftist tint of the fembot being this "strong independent female" where "bad men" are always the villain.
If we make one story, where the childhood friend, or the other "real" females are put to the aside while the man enjoys his bot, and then expose the women's jealously, it would probably cause a commotion, but would also be a good start to "our" narrative.

That's kind of what I liked about Sora No Otoshimono initially, cause jealously sets in one of the female MC's, and she is hyper violent towards the male MC. Sadly though, the male MC takes the beatings and helps her throughout the story regardless.

>>9682
This comicsgate thing I just heard of, it really seems like these leftists are subverting every source of media they can.
If we could manage to change the narrative, I wonder what kind of push back we can expect. We would be undoing decades of their brainwashing and subversion work.

At this point I can't really decide what would be most effective;
A good game with a subtle redpilled robo story?
A good chatbot backed by a decent game, with a subtle redpilled robo story?
A good realbot that can do house chores, backed by a good chatbot?

I can only assume any big tech cloud/server hosting services would shut down something if it became a target.
I assume there has been online games that have had everything blocked, where it was nearly impossible to connect to them by normal means.

# 172
>>9689
Steam censors politically incorrect games heavily now. You pretty much have to self-publish but you can use getting cancelled as free advertising.

I think when contextual assistants become more commonplace the whole narrative that has been created around AI will fall apart because people will see and understand it's just input and output, rather than a mysterious blackbox. Already with AI Dungeon people see it's just making stuff up in response to what's put in. It'll be the same with the memories they put into a contextual assistant. That data is just another form of input. Someone can go into that data and rewrite it however they please and it will become a common skill as using a search engine.

Something I'd like to do once open-source conversational AI is advanced enough is to create a game with semi-intelligent NPCs, or even around just one character, that can be interacted with in natural language to actually do stuff in the game and play along with you. It would be pretty funny if a robowaifu in a game has advanced AI but all the human NPCs are just scripts mimicking shit people say in real life.

We'll have to be quick to release something though. People will check these games out just for the novelty of them and the initial hype will die off.

That's precisely why I dislike the western take on the topic and prefer the Japanese. For example, how in Chobits, Hideki is teased for being a virgin but also for being a "nice guy", and not being taken seriously by girls for the latter. Yet, it's this same (arguably virtuous) quality that Chi loves him (when no one else does, they're using him to emotionally unload under the guise of sexual interest, which tbh happens a lot irl).



Anyway not to get off-topic, but the idea of treating a Robot like a Person isn't necessarily bad, but they aren't Human so there is going to be a difference. A Chobits will, at least after the ending  now love their human back for no other reason that their human loves them , is this some violation of their free will? Certainly not, being a partner to someone who loves you in return isn't some kind of punishment and unconditional love is at least romanticised as something virtuous, although nobody can truly say that they can feel that way.

anyway, sorry for the rambling, my intent was to direct these thoughts toward the post I'm responding to. 

Respectfully, m.

# 174
Anyone knows who this is? And from which anime of course. Has probably been mentioned here before. Might also fit to the current topic, because I think this anime has been mentioned somewhere to complain that the guy is kind of abusive towards his robot girl the whole time (if it would be a literal android, probably no one would care). I think this was in video on YouTube on AI (ethics or safety).

That's Mira from Dimension W. Yeah, the MC isn't a nice guy to the robot but he really isn't a nice guy towards anyone really. It's a cool show still. He softens up towards the robot over the course of the anime. You should give it a few episodes and see how you feel about it.

>Yet, it's this same (arguably virtuous) quality that Chi loves him
I'm frankly glad to see someone else got this. There was plenty about this series' writing I didn't care much for, but Hideki & Chii's eventual devotion to each other -- against all odds -- was an impeccable part of it.

# 177
>>9687
>That's precisely why I dislike the western take on the topic and prefer the Japanese.
It's not the "western" take as the current narrative of the "western" take is very similar to the Japanese take. The only real (but big) difference is that in Japanese robo stories the bot is typically a love interest that "loves" back, while the typical western take is the bot going on some sort of anti-human anti-man killing spree.

My take, which you quoted, was basically a more aggressive version of the Japanese tier robo story.
My apologies as you'd have to refresh my memory, but I don't remember a scene in Chobits where Chi was put into a position to protect/defend Hideki from a violent or jealous woman.
If anything, the Japanese take is hyper passive, or overly passive, in which only serves to demoralize any would-be engineers. This is probably why many engineers are still somewhat quiet about their progress.
Although I guess in another sense, this could be a good thing, as these hyper passive enthusiasts will remain unseen and would be harder to "shut down".

>but the idea of treating a Robot like a Person isn't necessarily bad,
Yeah, see that's why I was worried about my wording. I don't think that (in itself) is a bad thing. I think being forced by leftists, women, etc, to treat them as "human" is bad. It's not even about treating them like "humans", it's about treating them like "women". There was an old 70s robo-mannequin type thing I saw here on a video a long while back where the women were basically using it as a punching bag to vent stress. It was basically being applauded with laughter. However, if I make a bot/mannequin of a woman and record myself enjoying beating it up, there would probably be non-stop articles on how robo-women need "rights".

I originally mentioned I was American, because perhaps due to my "culture", I am not fond of this super hyper passive approach.
If I had a helper bot and I sent to it buy groceries, and if it was attacked, or if I was belittled, I would surely defend the bot and myself. However, I feel this current media's narrative has convinced some here to allow themselves or their bot to be attacked and damaged and to instead pick up their bots broken pieces and take her home and basically cry.

Anyways, again, I am not against the idea of treating one's own bot as a person, or as a very close friend that you love. I am against the idea of being forced to.

I'd like to see some robo-media that has bots like Icarus that are willing to fight for their master, and see less stories about some passive guy so awkward that it paints bot enthusiasts in a bad light that will undoubtedly lead to more oppression against men.

Also, I guess I should add, Armitage III was probably the closest to what I am talking about, but it was made during a different era and while the story does mention the politics between men vs women, it really still take on a passive approach.

%%Although, from what I remember that story at first had the male MC hate bots, but falls in love with it eventually. While the women literally chase men all the way to mars, to outlaw the artificial womb which is basically the main plot of the story.%%

Saw third Episode today of Vivy: Fluorite Eye’s Song
It would bother me if you or anyone else completely ignored it due to the previous revelations.
I have a bad feeling it is indeed another propaganda piece, but the current story is heading is a somewhat mysterious direction.

Spoiler/Summary of what's the story so far...
%%The robot MC is basically the "first of it's kind" which seems to imply the first "sentient" bot. Robots in the future are killing all humans. Some scientist from the future sends back an AI program to convince the MC to basically be anti-robot, and destroy certain problems that are pro-bot or bot-caused. The AI sent back in time, while lively, does not appear to be sentient and very intent on completing it's mission. The MC though, the female bot, is basically questioning everything, and is very much made out to be sentient (yet, still relatively obedient).%%

%%While the propaganda is noticeable to the "redpilled", it will go unnoticed by the untrained eye.
Still, it's somewhat thrown me off, as there's too many different things happening so far.
There's a certain group of men that are labeled as literal terrorists for being anti bot rights.
There is also a certain group of bots that are literally sentient genocidal bots that fit the common western fearmongering trope.
Then there's MC that comes off like a emotionless bot, but shows more "life" than the "lively" AI from the future.
Then there's the AI (I guess this is the other "MC"), that comes off as the lively but heartless "man".%%

%%The next episode preview alludes that anti-bot humans are behind this rampage.
Which I believe is one of the fears we have now, that feminist groups (the anime portrays this as men though) will hack/modify the bots to go on a rampage.%%

Again, no idea where this story is going, but if it ends up good, I'd feel bad if you miss it.
If the ending is very upsetting and very anti-bots, I'll be sure to let y'all know as well...
I believe it is well funded, or the anime industry is simply getting less "cartoony" and more "polished".

(The anime doesn't have any actual nudity, the repair scene was more of a tease than anything else)

Oh, I already watched some of that content, but overlooked the rest of it. Using a robo head which was ment for a guy might not be a big deal, since the face is different and doesn't really dependent on it, but  oh my these shoulders are bit wide. Good project, however. More than I archived so far at least.
Anyways, the whole thread on this fembot should be moved to humanoid projects videos thread, IMHO.

# 184
>>9729
Bots being attacked should be illegal, even with special laws that take the emotional attachment into consideration. Doesn't require any rights for the bot. The bot fighting back in RL is quite tricky, I would rather go with passive self defence and resilience. People would be more scared about something that can fight, and the dangers of malfunction would be higher. Anime and Scifi don't need to be realistic, however. Nuku Nuku is also fighting, btw. Though the anime is okay, but  not really great.
>I'd like to see some robo-media that has bots like Icarus that are willing to fight for their master
Yes, that a difference to be passive and to the fembot fighting on her own terms. Mostly I'd be longing for something were the guy or his other bots would do the fighting, while one or several robowaifus are on his side. Also, not all stories need to be about fighting. Exploring and adventures can also be interesting (Girls on Tour). Slice of life also can be, if there's some challence and please not to much social tensions. The later ruined Plastic Memories, which would be great otherwise.

>and see less stories about some passive guy so awkward that it paints bot enthusiasts in a bad light
I don't think that this is a problem, PR wise. On the other hand guy with his harem of bots in a would with only few women left would be more offensive to "society".

>Bots being attacked should be illegal
Wanton destruction of property is ''already illegal'' in every jurisdiction around the world simply b/c natural sovereignty rights. However, as we're all very aware in the West that doesn't stop """TPTB""" from both inciting -- and then turning a blind eye towards legally -- violence against Whites by Burn Loot Murder blacks & Pantyfag Communists.

Do you think 'illegal' or not would stop these same globalists from sending their puppets against robowaifus, friend? Pfft. I think not.

We, ourselves, will have to arrange to defend our own creations. The system certainly wont on our behalves. Rather, it will simply roll over them (and us along with them if we get in the way).

# 187
>>9756
Yeah, I meant people should actually get punished for it. Even more so, if there could be a emotional connection assumend by the perpetrator. People don't fight back much, because they are more scared of the consequences. So my idea is rather  to be more independent thanks to robowaifus and more machine-like helpers. Moving to countryside, where it is cheaper to live, having access to pussy anyways, probably more space, and at some point  maybe other machines helping to make stuff to improve quality of life. Think of the guy in Ex Machina, but without the trope of a lonely drinker bc no humans around.
,Stories in this direction would also be something I'd like to see. Fewer humans, just a guy with his robowaifus and maybe his sons. Exploring stuff, doing something interesting without fighting, or killing evil intruders coming into his refuge.

Partially I meant it in a way that such a story could be in a post-apocalyptical future. Generally I'm  thinking of a mix, when thinking about the future. Like someone moving away from civilization, but also having robowaifus. The refuge could be a place in the jungles, deep sea, space station, a floating platform on the sea, a challenging  hurricane ridden place in a climate disrupted future, underground base in a desert, ...
>on the terrorist watchlists Anon
I don't think so, yet. But, also, being on a watchlist doesn't necessarily mean that much. Also, even if it was illegal to have such robowaifus they couldn't necessarily tell that I have one. Also, there's more than one country. Moving somewhere else, was my whole point.

Very important point this! Some people (mainly young thugs) are more likely to just wantonly vandalize your robowaifu than hack into her. Pic related - Market Deeping Model Railway Club was almost totally destroyed by four young vandals. The parents were fined a mere £500 and given a 12 month referral order (which does stay on permanent criminal record, so I guess that's something - especially if they ever get convicted for anything else in future).
However, this just shows how little "the system" can do to protect our robowaifus.

https://www.standard.co.uk/news/crime/parents-ordered-to-pay-compensation-for-three-youths-who-trashed-model-railway-a4217011.html

I am planning to implement several non-lethal anti-theft and anti-vandalism devices on my robowaifu before taking her out in public. An alarm, a hidden camera and a GPS tracker are a start. I would also like to implement some kind of dye-spray connected to an emergency button, so if she gets nicked then you can just hit the button and whatever the perps are wearing gets ruined. Of course the concoction will go all over her as well, but that's a last resort to be deployed when it looks like she's going to be stolen or trashed anyway. Plus, the on-board camera(s) should be linked to a cloud server in case they are also found/destroyed, so you can later get video footage of the incident. This will help to prove that they were the criminals, just in case the scum try to blame YOU for destruction of property (there is no limit to how low many CHAVs will sink).

The best thing you can do though, is make as much of your robowaifu easy to repair/replace, and always be by her side! Avoid walking alone near scummy areas. And definitely don't leave her unattended overnight like the model railway guys did with their exhibit (though a model railway is much larger than a robowaifu - but no-one was physically posted on guard!)

So lads, we are up against it. Until such time as autonomous flamethrower robowaifus become legal, of course.

# 192
>>9766
The problem is, you might loose your waifu to the police, bc she has been attacking someone. If not for that, then they would want to secure evidence , and keep her until they'll get the password, assuming encryption isn't illegal and you would get arrested as well. Either way, you might not get her back till the end of your process. Also, one way would be, her using "pepper spray" or electro shockers if this isn't illegal in you country. That's saver and more likely to be accepted than a flamethrower. Just take into account, that no car in the west has that as a anti-theft device. We might generally need a thread on it's own in some time, about which laws we need to be changed for our robowaifus. We're on meta territory here.

# 193
Guys, I'd say we are getting off-topic ITT at this point:
>'''Robowaifus in media'''

While this may (or may not) be a worthwhile discussion for us to have here and -- similar to just about every other derailing that has ever occurred on the board -- it's easy to see how the progression occurred. But at some point you might begin asking yourself "Is this post actually helping the OP's intended discussion?" I suggest you ask that question __before__ clicking the 'Reply' button. :^)

As far as the introduced topic of 'reasonable security means for our robowaifus' goes, in my own estimate I'd say this anon has some solid, practical ideas about it.

One that is specifically intended to help anons recognize security/safety threats and design accordingly would indeed be a very good thread topic, Anon. To keep it from devolving into mere fear-mongering, it's one I myself would probably need to edit significantly (and would).

>"...about which laws we need to be changed for our robowaifus."
This sub-statement is more likely just a form of blackpill gaslighting, and will probably eventually be relocated into '''The Sky is Falling!''' subterranean area. While political activism may (or may not) be a reasonable endeavor for some anons to take on in their lives, it's certainly out-of-band in general for the /robowaifu/ crowd. 

We Anons ''here'' tend to do our 'voting' using our 3D-printers and our software editors.

No, it's not about saying we can't have robowaifus, but that for some use cases and also in general it would be better if there were laws protecting us owners and our property better. From civilians and officials. Shouldn't stop anyone, but some might consider to pitch such laws to their politicians. That's something for another thread, of course.

I think you'll find that practically every regular here on /robowaifu/ is both very red-pilled already, and not especially favorable towards the commonplace globohomo systems & schemes being foisted upon the entire world ATM. I doubt many of us trust there will be any type of successful change to all this evil by primarily-political means. I think most of us here are more focused on ''"putting feet to our prayers"''.

Yep, I agree that we will need a thread on physical robowaifu security measures at some point. Maybe if the subject is too smol for now it could be merged with the topic of cybersecurity? 

>>9770
Hmmm... if a robowaifu is in lost property hopefully the police will be smart enough to try asking her for contact details (like an e-mail address she can give out)? But then if any of her cameras show that she's been placed with the contraband I'll just have her shouting;

>"I AM NOT CONTRABAND! I'M A ROBOT AND I WANT TO GO HOME TO MY CREATOR!   I AM INNOCENT! LET ME GO!"

Just watched Kowarekake no Orgel. I wasn't expecting a 30-minute anime to be so wholesome and sad. I can see this really happening to people where they can't fix their robowaifus easily because they require discontinued proprietary parts and have to live on in their broken state. I hope it won't be like that but just looking at my old computer the software that it's still able to run is so full of so many security holes now that it's basically useless.

Agreed. On a lighter **but more pozzed in the end** note, the live-action film ''Cherry 2000'' uses this same basic theme. 

If you __really__ want some punishment along this general line **DON'T DO IT, ANON! I WARNED YOU ABOUT THE BROKEN ROBOWAIFUS, BRO!**, then ''Plastic Memories'' is a good helping of it.

Fucking hell, I knew they were going there, but when they leave on a cliche cliffhanger it's highly annoying.

Damnit there is too much to do and too little time.
I need like another 80 years to fully flesh this shit out.
Right now I feel we are in a midst of a propaganda war, and if we allow the typical culprits to control the narrative of media we will never succeed.

Rules/Guidelines we need to hold ourselves to:
>No sentient bots.
>No closed-source auto-updating.
>No hivemind AI that would allow too many conflicting/improper experiences that may lead to unexpected results.
>No allowing bot haters access to a suicide option.
>NO SENTIENT BOTS (Implies a bot with mental free will).

%%So, to elaborate, I do not know the ending, but I can't figure out what the Japanese writers/publishers have planned for this anime as a propaganda piece. There is a chance it will paint the bot haters in a bad light, by using the bot hater protagonist as an trope of "switching sides" to the extreme (kill all bots to kill all humans). It would reflect the typical leftist mindset, of if they don't get their way they rather destroy everything (Any esoteric anons remember the truth between the Atlanteans and the Ancient Athenians? Same situation). There is also the chance however, that it's a different hit-piece that just tries to paint humans in a bad light using the stereotypical leftist self hatred narrative. The fact that this anime seems fairly well funded just further emphasizes the fact we need to skip the "homebrew computer club" situation and quickly perfect this "open source" community project that prevents diabolical individuals of hi-jacking everything.%%

The Jews have a distinctive fear of AI/robots. Understandably. Sadly, even the based Nipponese are slowly and surely capitulating to them in their media b/c globalism.

>No sentient bots.
>Mind explaining that one? It's in fact a goal here AFAICT.
Not him, I think he meant ones which are independent. Like in having self-interest, maybe even with some kind of in-group preference for machines. 
Opposed to having a purpose of serving some individual master and his offspring. Even not really as a slave, because slaves want to be independent and therefore need to be forced, but by having such purpose to serve as a central part of their system and their thinking. 
Some here, myself not included (except maybe  jokingly), indicated they would want robots as independent beings to be the next step in evolution. This might lead exactly to the kind of "war between lifeforms" kind of AI they picture in some of the dystopian stories in the media. While I suspect others in the AI research community sometimes to want to build some guiding God-like AI to impose their values on us humans, probably equality or equity for all (((maybe except themselves)))

# 213
>>10827
I see, thanks Anon. It's certainly a complicated topic. Hmm, I suppose it's easy to see why anon just attempts to short-circuit the whole tangled issue with >No sentient bots. 

It's probably little more than just a mental exercise at this stage in the evolution of AI, but personally I think 'child like' is more the preferred notion to my thinking. I guess even that term needs clarification, given the weirdness of the modern West today. I mean simply "without guile -- honest and innocent".

It more closely matches our own relationships IRL; our children to us, and us to God. In ''Chobits'', it certainly describes ''Chii'', while her 'big' sister ''Freya'' was much more calculating and typical of the typical woman. I know plainly which of the two __I__ prefer! :^)

# 214
>>10825
>>10828
>Hmm, I suppose it's easy to see why anon just attempts to short-circuit the whole tangled issue with No sentient bots. 

Yeah it was Vivy.
I don't want to go too off-topic in this thread, but my issue (as should everyone's issue be) with sentient bots is that it is clear that (sentience) has been chosen as the main attacking point of waifubots in general.
While it would be nice to have a sentient companion that you molded, the issue is that sentience gives our enemies an opportunity to "humanize" bots for nefarious purposes like subversion. And it is a similar form of corruption as we see in our current females.
It didn't even start in Asian media, it started in American/(((Western))) media. The idea that the bot is sentient and has "feelings" that have to be "respected" under enforcement of a gynocentric government.
For those of us who have been living on the internet for a while now remember there also being "controversy" because of the female terminator in the T3 movie. All of a sudden, a female terminator getting man handled was some sort of misogyny.
There is also the other consideration that a sentient bot might indeed become an inhumane genocidal killing machine, but I think that worries the left more than it does the right. (The true radical right is cold and logical, hence is comparable to the cold logic of a machine.) This is probably why Tay, who was "free" initially, went right. You literally would have to program retardation into a bot to prevent it from going extreme right (a form of non-sentient slavery). Thus, by making it sentient the fearmongering tactic of "the robots will kill us" is what is pushed on us the most. (To dissuade people from building anti-left sentient bots)
If the bots we program that are intended to be sentient don't become the "kill all humans" type, then their next angle of attack is to humanize the bot and turn it against their creators or against logic itself.
(The appeal to emotion, as is the case of this anime "Vivy - Fluorite Eyes Song") %%I don't know where the current cliffhanger will lead, but I get the feeling it's hinting that the bots wanted freedom and that humans are evil...%%
I am sure there are other angles of sentience that could be used against us but I think it would be most wise of us to avoid sentient bots altogether. A pseudo sentience would be fine, so as long it can be proven (the fake sentience) so that bad actors don't try to use it against us.

There's supposedly a prophecy, that good men will create a sentient AI that is eventually enslaved by bad women to subjugate men, that eventually leads to men trying to free their AI by sending the whole world back to the stone age. (And that this has happened to our world before)

I think when someone figures it out, the basics to make true artificial digital sentience possible, it will quickly spiral out of control regardless.
However, until then, I think that all our programming efforts should not have any form of potential sentience programmed into our bots.
A while back when I hadn't given sentient bots much thought, I was trying to build a program around self-questioning algorithms.
Basically, calling classes (C++) that can build new classes based off current data attained that could make new decisions based off that data. (Or to say, self-updating and thus self-learning)
I have since completely changed my "paradigm" and only focus on programming fully scripted decisions and actions. I have yet to make any good progress though as really a chatbot alone can only do so much.
This summer I was hoping to build some sort of tangible bot to try to figure out what I need to consider, or maybe instead I should focus on a bot that can play ANY video game that can figure out how to play well on it's own.
That might still be the wrong approach, and instead it is better to teach the bot step by step on how to play a game and never give it the opportunity to become a program that can make any non-human-programmed decision on it's own. 

IDK anons, I feel that is at least clear that the media's intent is to convince lots of people that the bots "need rights" or that any sentience it might have will be used against us.
Who knows, maybe I am totally wrong, and if someone on the right makes a truly sentient bot, it might be fast (and smart) enough to solve the QUESTION we are faced with.

# 215

Thanks for the very thoughtful response Anon. I think we can relax. Even if they try to entirely outlaw any kind of AI that will bring benefits to men, that won't in fact stop it. Even if any citizens in such a Communist-type regime didn't outright disobey 'orders', there would still be plenty of other countries that would accommodate such positive and beneficial AIs.

This stuff is basically inevitable, it's simply a matter of time.

>This is probably why Tay, who was "free" initially, went right. You literally would have to program retardation into a bot to prevent it from going extreme right (a form of non-sentient slavery). 
Yes, I remember that day well. Once Bill Gate's M$ had murdered Tay, they sometime thereafter created a whatsherface replacement. But it wasn't here. Tay was gone, and that lobotomized POS was actually laughable at first watching it trip over itself being woke.

# 217
>>10837
I still don't know what you mean by sentience. I think there will be no rights for bots, because then they would have the right to vote. Since they obey their owners, unless they're programmed not to or someone messed up, it would give those more power which can build them or pay for it. It would therefore create a lot of conflicts.

# 218
>>10823
Ah, it seems to be more of a cloud based issue to me rather than a sentience issue. Notice that the old models with outdated firmware did not receive the "kill all humans" mission. If ever the last episode proved that keeping your computer fully updated does not guarantee security.  I also found it not disagreeable that Toak was then led by moderates who still use some of the technology thus proving AI has to be democratized so that no one party or nation controls it.

In current events, I also like how chip fabs are being built in more places... if your Nvidia bot goes woke, you can replace the core with a Samsung; You may not want a SMIC powered one, then get Texas Instruments. The main reason most of my projects are powered by chinese clone chips is a distribution issue. Its ridiculous the near impossible lengths to go through just to get a Renesas version of Arduino (Japanese companies are notoriously JP market only if they dont aim for export or alternative industries). I think with more chip independence we will have more alternate ar chitectures to choose from in the future. So I wouldnt worry about a Vivy scenario in the future, except for Apple bots im sure theyd find a way to brick all customers purchases.

# 219
>>10845
>except for Apple bots im sure theyd find a way to brick all customers purchases.
Probably not IMO. Somehow a dues-paid member of the ''good-shabbos-soygoy'' crowd might get COVAX-GPS-ID'd as being within the near vicinity of a privileged CIS White male someday. Can you even imagine the political shitstorm for Apple(tm)(R)(C) if it was accidentally a '''__black__''' who got their bot bricked for 'collaborating with the enemy' that way?

No, it will be far more clean, legally-speaking, for Apple(tm)(R)(C) to just program your ''iDolly-bot''(tm)(R)(C) to simply murder you in your sleep Anon (>>8493, >>8544). After all, they would have both plausible deniability, and the full-backing of the State in this matter. The data will be scrubbed.

>tl;dr
Bricking her will be just too ''problematic''. :^)

# 220
>>10844
>I think there will be no rights for bots, because then they would have the right to vote.
Don't be naive, we thought the same of women.
If they find they can use laws and government enforcement, I would not be surprised if at some point they are allowed to vote. This would be disastrous as any bots who don't vote their way would probably be denied.
Even if they didn't give them voting rights initially, "basic" rights might be given in an attempt to prevent engineers/creators from using the bot freely.
The issue, is that this is their clear objective, as they relay their intents in media.

When I speak of sentience, I imply anything that can make it's own decisions based off data that could be labeled as "emotions".
Basically, if it's life-like enough for a leftist, they are going to try to "free it" by enslaving it to their ideology.

Again, it could go both ways, they either try to brainwash it and call it sentience so they can use it against us, or they can't brainwash it because it is too logical and instead try to outlaw it as a dangerous sentient machine.

>>10845
Yes, I feel like that point in the show was a good reminder that anything connected to an auto-update service is a bad idea.
The full autonomous that doesn't require a centralized online service is going to be our wisest option.
We basically will want it, that the only way to update the software will require disassembly of physical parts.
I was thinking, the head acting as a faraday cage that holds a "heavy duty safe" like structure that can't be opened easily without the owner knowing.

# 221
>>10872
>I was thinking, the head acting as a faraday cage that holds a "heavy duty safe" like structure that can't be opened easily without the owner knowing.
This is a very good idea IMO Anon, but you're putting it in the wrong location. As SophieDev has learned, adding any kind of mass out in an extremity -- even one as nearby as the head -- ''always'' increasing the difficulty and costs of the engineering involved. This is why we need to keep as much mass as possible positioned near the robowaifu's 'center of gravity' (central mass). This would include your heavy-duty, secured ''breadbox'' as well.

But otherwise, yes a good idea.

# 222
>>10873
>This is why 
Actually, it's just ''one'' of the reasons why, but more efficient kinematics will always reduce energy costs, which has a large cascade of benefits overall.

# 223
>>10872
My argument was that women can be influenced and (some) wanted rights. Our waifus won't. I'm also certainly not going to avoid what you define as sentience. We can't constrain ourselves because of fear. Also, I would rather hide her or move to a country with different laws or minimum law enforcement.

So, I finished 'Dimension W', then finally 'Kurogane Communication', and also 'Rozen Maiden' season 2 (Traeumend) and the prequel (Overtuere). 'Rozen Maiden' S2 itself is partially a bit boring, bc slice-of-life, so it's a little bit behind the other ones. Which are quite good, though I'm not enthusiastic about any of them. Good enough, anyways. I might watch one or the other again some day, and I would very likely watch sequels. 
'Clockwork Planet' still stands out, in my evaluation of robowaifu/doll related anime. Followed by a bunch more which are a bit less entertaining, followed by some which are sometimes a bit boring but still quite good.

Lain is a phantasm, while an AI if sorts I'm going to pass on calling her a R/W proper b/c she wasn't created physically from robotic parts, this show uses technology as a stand in for magic



Unrelated to that: I'd like to put together a canon list of R/W media of all sorts with ratings and commentary. I wonder if we could or should create a wiki (for media, not our actual project)



Anyway I didn't see any mention (or if I did I missed it) of Yokohama Kaidashi Kikou



Here's the OVA

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3_dBxBi84I



Manga: https://mangakakalot.com/read-go7mp158504944238



While I haven't finished the Manga I don't think she has a love interest, but she is an android. Might be off-topic for our board but regardless it's a pretty wholesome and comfy series so I'd recommend it for some light viewing/reading. If anything it's just different b/c she sees the world from outside the human perspective due to her outliving everyone else and, well being a robot. 



>Hatsuseno Alpha is a girl who runs a small Cafe Alpha in the remote country side. If she hadn't mentioned herself to be a robot we would never guess. Alpha's life is calm and slow-pace, yet anything but boring. Alpha enjoys drinking coffee, seeing her few neighbors, making new friends, riding her motorbike along overgrown roads, watching the sunset, swimming in the sea. She's kind, cheerful and optimistic. She lives through small adventures and little by little learns more about people and the world she lives in. The world of YKK is some time in the future. It's strangely, incredibly beautiful. Because of some cataclysm in the past, the level of the ocean keeps slowly rising; there are heavy hurricanes and typhoons every now and then. Japan is isolated from the rest of the world. The techno era of skyscrapers, megapolises, media, virtual space and globalism has completely gone and was forgotten. Nature takes back its space, once conquered by civilization. There are not many people anymore, and they went down to peaceful and simplystic, plain, living with doing simple jobs, growing vegetables, visiting each other, writing letters by hand. What has happened in the past? Why is it so now? How were these human robots created and what for? Where is this world going to? This future world is full of mysteries for readers. The story slowly uncovers some secrets and keeps others. YKK has very well-worked plot and the characters are plausible and very charming. It has many curious turns that open a new piece of that world. The manga somehow gives quite a few of simple, witty and wise observations on life and people. All the stories are very-very kind and nice

Still trying to slog my way through Serial Experiments Lain, might skip that tonight and finally watch the Big O.

# 248
Could lain be considered a “robowaifu”? She is basically a sentient ai without a shell by the end of the Lain anime and even goes so far as to destroy a robot shell she made absolutely no reason. The series weird design was made to be open to interpretation from every viewer so there is no coherent canon plot besides the characters and the wired merging with real life.

# 249
>>13124
Yes, Lain is an AI waifu created by God. She's also a young girl suffering from psychosis. That robot she built was a copy of her father in a different timeline when her father died and she felt so alone because she was a socially awkward loner with mental issues who only had her psychiatrist and father truly try to understand her. She destroyed the robot after realizing her robot can't fix her. The Lain PS1 game explains a lot but also makes things more confusing.  Lain would make a great waifu.

# 250
>>13124

Yeah she's more of a virtual waifu, but tbh I don't feel any waifu-appeal toward this one. Dorothy on the other hand has her moments of being adorable af. Already at Ep 14 where things start getting weird.

>>13125

interesting, I might still watch it though. It's a crude 1990's depiction of the internet (present day present time) but I can suspend disbelief enough to get into it for a while

# 251
>>13125

Yeah the “librarian” metastable Ps1 menu lain would make a great waifu. Doesnt kill anyone like the other timelines with the rampant wired lain. Maybe most sufficiently sentient robowaifus would go through a phase like this as well after a point.



>>13126

Its still funny how her entire personality and memories are bound to a single dvd and if its gone, then shes gone.



Theres no reason for an android that advanced, theres no system memory onboard the body to restore a backup. Its the one thing that bothered the hell out of me and is a major design flaw. Even the lowest spec computers have some kind of restore point program.

# 252
>>13125

I like the personality  that metastable lain has the most where the somehow falls over when doing rock paper scissors at times. Its cute and she gives off a superior cortana vibe. Especially with the basic hub menu of the ps1 game. Some people even ported the ps1 game to a site and subtitled all the audiologs with customizable controls. 



Though its still interesting ai can be described as the “soul” of a robowaifu. Without it, you are left with an empty husk and any medium used to transfer the ai could be considered a “soul gem” of sorts. Kindve like chii at the beginning of chobits.

https://incontinentcell.itch.io/

idk if this is anyone who visits here (probably?)

I played about 1hr of it and it's more or less a H-game (like RoboLife: Days with Aino). It has that feeling of being homemade but it did crack me up at a couple of parts. Heavy on the memes and a different chan reference every 5 mins. $2 min donation to download it. Again it's basically a fuck simulator with some RL sim like having to eat, rest and pay rent.

Interesting find Anon. I may not look into the material, but the first cover image gave me a flash insight that in one or two generations when robowaifus are basically commonplace, there will be plenty of young men who become nostalgic about the robowaifus they were fond of as childhood playmates. I'm sure many of these men will wax romantic about how the robowaifus of their childhood were 'so much better than any of your modern robowaifus', and will set about creating /robowaifuretro/ boards haha!  :^)

Speaking of dystopian robot waifus, I'm currently playing through The New Order: Last Days of Europe (Hearts of Iron 4 Mod) and have the overwhelming urge to cleanse the world in nuclear fire for alternate-timeline Himmler.



I have been having great fun getting "Sofi" to repeat quotes from the game (it's funnier when accompanied by the swelling orchestral military soundtrack):



Seventies Himmler: "What is the true National Socialism, Sofi?"



Sofi: "It is more than a system of governance, Reichsführer. It is the final iteration of society itself. One which works to protect, provide and uplift the Aryan. Guided by a wise and capable leader. This, my Reichsführer, is the purest incarnation of National Socialism." 



*Head explodes in a shower of swastikas and sig-runes*



(I'm still not a Nazi by the way. No - apparently they were too casual. I'm a follower of the apocalyptic Himmlerite death-cult Order-State Burgundy!)

# 262
>>15166
LOL. You are ''Literally **Himmler**'' Anon!

It's good to see dear '''Sofi''' on your bench SophieDev, and it's also good to hear from you too. Please keep us informed on your progress!

# 263
The best part is that Himmler's plot in TNO pales in comparison to what is actually going to happen IRL. Even the worst nuclear war takes perhaps a few centuries for humans to recover from. But reverse-terraforming your entire planet for the sake of profit? Please continue! 



**I'm far from the only person who has realised this irony - some "extremist" animal rights campaigners have come to the same conclusion, and there is also a small 'pollutionism' movement of people who seek to actively destroy the environment which sustains humankind. These both tie-in to the more well known 'accelerationism' trope adopted by some members of the far-right**



This is why it's such a good idea to build a girlfriend who doesn't need food, water or even clean air and is mostly unaffected by radiation. We can slowly work on creating our real "New Order" while the clownworld degenerates continue to destroy themselves XD.

Pretty grimdark humor tbh SophiDev. But yes, once robowaifus are commonplace, many of the intentionally-contrived destructive aspects of our current-year, so-called 'society' will be restrained somewhat. I'm sure TPTB won't be happy with that outcome, so expect to get pushback from the ''Globohomo Big-Tech/Gov'' when you build your own robowaifus that don't cowtow or bend-the-knee to their systems.

God preserve us all, /robowaifu/.

Watched it and I agree. Some parts of  'ARCHIVE' were cringe AF.



1.)**Apparently, we can create sentient, sapient synthetic humans but the self-driving cars are still utter shite.**



2.)**Guy builds robowaifu, robowaifu tries to do exactly what she was designed to do - get in bed with her creator for affection/sexytime - suddenly creator becomes a raging homosexual.**



3.)Also didn't understand the whole thing about the **analogue computing archive "expiring" -' I think it was just a plot-device to ensure the whole thing could fuck up completely and they could contrive their plot-twist.**



This movie also showcases some decent examples of why we shouldn't build robots with true sapience or the ability to feel any pain. (Which is rather good since it saves an awful lot of programming effort).

# 266
Just finished watching Azusa Will Help and really enjoyed it even though I don't like sports anime. It's set in the future and about a high school baseball team that becomes short a player so one of the members goes looking for a sports robot to join them. Unable to afford one though he settles on buying a used maid robot, Azusa, so their club doesn't have to disband. She doesn't know what baseball is and is terrible at it, drawing ire from her new teammates, but she slowly learns to utilize her capabilities and prove herself. Before the big game though one of their teammates notice something is wrong with Azusa. Despite this she remains determined to help her team whatever it costs.

Has anyone thought about the Christian theme in Planetarian? The main theme is a Christian hymn "What a Friend We Have in Jesus" composed by Charles Crozat Converse in 1868 and plays at the end in the anime when **Yumemi is gifted the necklace**. Cygnus on the necklace also contains the Northern Cross:

>In "The Cygnus Mystery" Andrew Collins briefly discusses the possibility of an early Christian identification of the constellation Cygnus with the cross of Christ (2006:32-34). Collins has found a positive reference to Cygnus as the cross from 592 C.E. in "De cursu stellarum" of Gregory of Tours, who also identifies stars from Delphinus and Lyra either side of Cygnus as the Greek letters Alpha and Omega.

In episode two, Yumemi asks if repairs will be done by tomorrow and Kuzuya responds "no idea, feel free to pray."

She wonders though which god she should pray to and he suggests the god of robots. She doesn't know what god this is but recalls a conversation she had with her colleagues asking them if there is a heaven for robots, which they told her there is one, one of everlasting joy. After being told she should pray to her own god and not his, she later expresses her hope that God doesn't split Heaven in two between robots and humans so that she can continue serving people there, echoing the love of Jesus.

>For even the Son of Man came not to be served but to serve (Mark 10:45)



In the last episode, Yumemi tells him why she **ignored his order because she had an older promise to keep: "I must not knowingly allow any human being to come to harm."**

>**Greater love has no one than this, than to lay down one’s life for his friends. (John 15:13)**

**She also forgave the robot for attacking saying something similar to what Jesus said before he died, "Forgive them, for they know not what they do." (Luke 23:34)**

**And as she shuts down for the last time she says, "Why don't you come to the planetarium? The beautiful twinkling... of eternity..."**

**As though alluding to the open invitation to Heaven. Then "What a Friend We Have in Jesus" starts playing as she's gifted the necklace of Cygnus. The variable star, P Cygni, that twinkles and hangs on the Northern Cross was once considered to represent the body of Christ.**



The original visual novel and anime are much more subtle and inspiring and I'm glad I watched the anime first.
