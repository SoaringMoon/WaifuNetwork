I don't know anything about the book OP mentioned but here's a video of the man's work for those who don't know of him yet:

and there's a general here on him as well:

Can we talk about the man who DID IT? Seriously he did it, he achieved our dream and started a project to help all those who want their own robowaifu, then, why does not anyone support him in TWO FUCKING YEARS?

A better question is what has he done since he unveiled his creation in 2016? His crowd funding for a book and 3d files on assembling your own robot is still half way off selling enough preorders to be able to do a print run(will it print in 2019? 2020?), he knows better than to sell an easily pirated ebook in this day and age. His 'share lab' that was supposed to be a community of fellow robot builders that collaboratively improved his robot design is nothing but a vague promise he made years ago. Even if he released his book tomorrow for free and set up a basic wiki and web forum for his project it's too little too late.  
  
Either this guy squandered all the mainstream media attention he received or he doesn't want the hassle involved with helping others and would rather work on his own. I'd put my money on the later as the majority of people on the internet nowadays are terrible.

Best for him to stay out of the spotlight.  
  
The creators of Samantha had more up until media furor and physical attacks forced them to strip everything:

Meaning? Everyone does their part by being here and contributing. Seeing that none of us got the opportunity he had, there isn't really a sense of irony.

What happened?  
  
Last good capture for anyone curious:

The British business partner who featured in the talk show was doxxed and his house visited and called a pervert.

all right, fair enough. you have my apologies anon. Here's an English-translated video about him. From ~2017. I have no idea what the status of his crowd-funding project is but I wish him good fortune in his endeavors. He seems to have a somewhat similar sentiment to /robowaifu/ based on his comments in this video. [https://youtube.com/watch?v=rGnddjcusp0](https://youtube.com/watch?v=rGnddjcusp0)
