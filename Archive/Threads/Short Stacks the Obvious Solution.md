If we want a robowaifu that anyone can make at home then we will need to make it small enough to be printed on a cheap 3d printer.  Let's say the ender 3 because it has a large printing area and a large community because it is so affordable.  Our robowaifu doesn't have to be printed all in one go; in fact it would probably be better if our robowaifu was printed in parts, those parts used to make silicone casts around robotic internals. 
   Short stack robowaifus provide an easily printable solution and require considerably less materials to make than conventional sexbots.  They could be easier and cheaper for the average man to produce.  There is also a large community surrounding short stacks as it is a popular fetish.  Goblins, kobold, dwarfs, halflings, and gnomes are very popular in fantasy and several 3d models for them can easily be found on the internet which would give men options for their robowaifus.
   Engineering a smaller robowaifu would also be considerably easier.  Less stress would be put on her skeleton and less energy would be required to make her move.  Short stacks in particular often have thicker legs and feet which would fix a lot of issues with balance.
What are your thoughts /robowaifu/ have you taken the short stack pill?

Satan, pls.

Yes, the topics of the ramifications of the ''Square-cube Law'' have come up numerous times in our brief history at /robowaifu/.

>Goblins, kobold, dwarfs, halflings, and gnomes are very popular in fantasy and several 3d models for them can easily be found on the internet which would give men options for their robowaifus.
Our good friends over at /monster/ certainlly might have a strong interest, but frankly, the vast majority of us would not. Beauty is one of the goals for our robowaifu companions. And as soon as you start producing child-sized models of companion robots you not only paint a large target on the manufacturer by threatened roasties **as well as the always-offended feminists ofc**, you also run afoul of actual US law that has been introduced on the very topic. 

This was done by lawmakers who probably couldn't give af about it in fact, but saw the posturing as a good political move for an 'easy moral victory' to help their careers along. Nobody has the desire to vote against such a clear ''Won't someone please think of the children!?'' bill ofc.

It's certainly not something I will allow us to openly support here on /robowaifu/ therefore. What you do in the privacy of your own garage lab is ofc your own affair--also stipulated by law **for the moment at least**.

I might also add that much of the East has no such compunctions regarding so-called 'lolibots', and highly neotenous dolls are already readily-available there. However even owning one of these has been deemed anathema in the US, and would likely land you in the newspaper after customs 'inspects' this child-sized package.

My robowaifu is going to be the same height as Chii, 152cm/5'0". I'd hate to make her shorter and then she can't reach the cupboard or something and asks me why did I make her so short. Most of her won't be made with a 3d printer either except to prototype joint parts before sending them off for CNC machining.

If you wanna go really cheap there are ball-jointed dolls you can download and 3D print. People on a budget will probably opt for making smart dolls out of TPE rather than expensive silicone. And the strange thing is that a smart doll doesn't even need hands to play a computer game or a camera to watch something together. All it needs is an input/output interface. It'll probably make a great feature for someone with a gardevoir smart doll.

Yes, that's my perfect size as well. As OP points out and mentioned ITT the square-cube effects present a significant difficulty-multiplier to practically every aspect of the engineering involved. But we're madmen enough to undertake this adventure in the first place, so who's going to let a little thing like having to defeat the Triple-Boss of this game to win the prize stop us heh? :^)

Short stacks usually have pretty decent assets.  Is the law really retarded enough to consider them to be child-like?

I'm sure that short stacks aren't going to be ideal for most people's robowaifus, but the sooner we get some kind of prototype up and running the sooner we can start refining the systems and designs nessicary to build bigger and better robowaifus.  Short stacks would be a good starting point.

Heh, I would never underestimate the insanity of 'the law' at this stage of our Western Tradition, Anon. But no probably not as long as it looked like some kind of gremlin, etc. But the moment you start making it look like a pretty little White girl, then you just triggered the trap card nigga. I clarified my point that 'beauty' **whatever that means, but I think we all get it** was a common goal. Mixing beauty and neoteny in our robowaifus is a direct assault on roasties and on the social status-quo, and is a guaranteed target on not only our backs, but on Robi & Co's. I can't allow us to go there publicly-speaking. Again, what you do in your own lab is, for the moment, your own affair. Certainly it's none of mine nor of /robowaifu/'s.

>>2687
Sure that's fine Anon. Just make sure they don't skirt the line of beautiful girls and we should be fine here.

# 9
I won't be making her look like a little white girl.  I'm probably going to go with a goblin.  I want to try a cooling system using the large ears.

>I'm probably going to go with a goblin.  
Sure, that's perfectly fine.
>I want to try a cooling system using the large ears.
Yes there's a nice symbiosis possible between the surface materials and passive cooling systems. Good idea.

Ahh, got it. Can you find any old models of that Anon? They look like a pretty useful design tbh. Even just technical drawings might suffice to work out a kit parts from a 3D printer and such.

I particularly like the design of that tallest one, somehow.

Well, I'd say you're golden then. Can you draw? They don't have to be ''perfect'' **not yet, anyway heh** but technical drawings are always the starting point for these kinds of things, generally speaking.

# 20
>>3091
No I can't draw worth a damn.  Is there a free program I could use to make technical drawings?

# 21
I also want her hear, arms, and waist to be able to move as well.  Are there any simple solutions for those?  Is it even realistic at this point to have her make facial expressions?

# 22

>Is there a free program I could use to make technical drawings?
Fusion360 is a great tool, and Autodesk has a program available for amateurs:
https://www.autodesk.com/campaigns/fusion-360-for-hobbyists
A) I don't trust Autodesk very much, and B) it's strictly cloud-based. So if they deplatform you or you lose internet, you're basically hosed from any further work on your project. But all-in-all it's a remarkably good product for engineering work like this, and directly supports 3D printing software.

Another possibility is SolidWorks, and they are offering a special deal to EAA members. Both are cheap.
>>1175

Finally, ofc there's always Blender. And today, that's a very good choice indeed, given the improvements in version 2.8 of the project.

We actually have a thread on this specific topic Anon, the catalog is always your friend here.
>>414

>>3101
Yep everything else has to work as well. I'd recommend really digging in and getting your legs idea going first though Anon. Not only will you learn valuable lessons in the process (and help us all out here as well), but it will serve as a good 'base' after a fashion for you to build up the rest of the project. '''Just do it!''' :^)
>Are there any simple solutions for those?
In a word: no. We're pioneering inexpensive, simple approaches here on /robowaifu/ as we go, Anon.
>Is it even realistic at this point to have her make facial expressions?
It is, but it's either rather sophisticated **ie, expensive** such as the theme-park animatronics system Disney devised for the Avatar ride, or tends to be kludgey, such as various amateur efforts we've seen thus far (and I'm not judging them, this stuff is very hard to get right tbh). A middle-ground between the two needs to be pioneered here, actually.

# 23
>>3106
At this point all I want her to do is to be able to wave, hug, move her head, and move her waist so she could turn.  A face that cod smile and make seductive faces would be nice too.  Does anyone have some ideas for some simple solutions?

# 24
>>3136
In that case I would focus on a torso-only solution, which also brings quite a few benefits to the table as well Anon. Hanson Robotics started off just making heads, and then grew it from there to a torso. Today, I believe they are probably dabbling with giving Sophia a functional body.

I have noticed a very serious design flaw with these legs and I am surprised no one has pointed it out.  How are you going to spread her legs?

# 28
>>3167
Haha good point. I'm sure a good solution would be arrived at, they say ''necessity is the mother of invention'' after all. I think the design we see in nature is the best to follow on this issue if possible. A robo-hip-joint is needed ofc. My designs use biomemetics of the human form and include a ball & socket approach for the hip. After all, it's literally the most efficient design for all the motions needed. A 3-axis servo design could be devised as well in a case like this. It might serve well enough, I think.

The whole system for leg motions is an oft-neglected masterpiece of engineering and aesthetic design.

# 29
>>3167
Think something like these would be better?

# 30
>>3209
Now you've got the idea Anon. 3-axis motion will basically be necessary for our robowaifu's 'hip' joints.
