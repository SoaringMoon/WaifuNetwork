If we want a robowaifu that anyone can make at home then we will need to make it small enough to be printed on a cheap 3d printer. Let's say the ender 3 because it has a large printing area and a large community because it is so affordable. Our robowaifu doesn't have to be printed all in one go; in fact it would probably be better if our robowaifu was printed in parts, those parts used to make silicone casts around robotic internals. 

Short stack robowaifus provide an easily printable solution and require considerably less materials to make than conventional sexbots. They could be easier and cheaper for the average man to produce. There is also a large community surrounding short stacks as it is a popular fetish. Goblins, kobold, dwarfs, halflings, and gnomes are very popular in fantasy and several 3d models for them can easily be found on the internet which would give men options for their robowaifus. 

Engineering a smaller robowaifu would also be considerably easier. Less stress would be put on her skeleton and less energy would be required to make her move. Short stacks in particular often have thicker legs and feet which would fix a lot of issues with balance. 

What are your thoughts /robowaifu/ have you taken the short stack pill?

>What are your thoughts /robowaifu/ have you taken the short stack pill? 

Satan, pls. Yes, the topics of the ramifications of the _Square-cube Law_ have come up numerous times in our brief history at /robowaifu/. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square%E2%80%93cube_law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square%E2%80%93cube_law)

Our good friends over at /monster/ certainlly might have a strong interest, but frankly, the vast majority of us would not. Beauty is one of the goals for our robowaifu companions. And as soon as you start producing child-sized models of companion robots you not only paint a large target on the manufacturer by threatened roasties as well as the always-offended feminists ofc, you also run afoul of actual US law that has been introduced on the very topic. This was done by lawmakers who probably couldn't give af about it in fact, but saw the posturing as a good political move for an 'easy moral victory' to help their careers along. Nobody has the desire to vote against such a clear _Won't someone please think of the children!?_ bill ofc. It's certainly not something I will allow us to openly support here on /robowaifu/ therefore. What you do in the privacy of your own garage lab is ofc your own affair--also stipulated by law for the moment at least.

I might also add that much of the East has no such compunctions regarding so-called 'lolibots', and highly neotenous dolls are already readily-available there. However even owning one of these has been deemed anathema in the US, and would likely land you in the newspaper after customs 'inspects' this child-sized package.

My robowaifu is going to be the same height as Chii, 152cm/5'0". I'd hate to make her shorter and then she can't reach the cupboard or something and asks me why did I make her so short. Most of her won't be made with a 3d printer either except to prototype joint parts before sending them off for CNC machining. 

If you wanna go really cheap there are ball-jointed dolls you can download and 3D print. People on a budget will probably opt for making smart dolls out of TPE rather than expensive silicone. And the strange thing is that a smart doll doesn't even need hands to play a computer game or a camera to watch something together. All it needs is an input/output interface. It'll probably make a great feature for someone with a gardevoir smart doll.

Yes, that's my perfect size as well. As OP points out and mentioned ITT the square-cube effects present a significant difficulty-multiplier to practically every aspect of the engineering involved. But we're madmen enough to undertake this adventure in the first place, so who's going to let a little thing like having to defeat the Triple-Boss of this game to win the prize stop us heh? :^)

Short stacks usually have pretty decent assets. 

Is the law really retarded enough to consider them to be child-like?

I'm sure that short stacks aren't going to be ideal for most people's robowaifus, but the sooner we get some kind of prototype up and running the sooner we can start refining the systems and designs nessicary to build bigger and better robowaifus. Short stacks would be a good starting point.
