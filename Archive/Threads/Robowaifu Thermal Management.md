Question: How are we going to solve keeping all the motors, pumps, computers, sensors, and other heat-producing gizmos inside a real robowaifu cooled off anons?

# 2
>>234
I'm no expert, but I'll throw out some ideas that I always thought might not just help with function, but with verisimilitude, which IMO is the name of the game. Each method I have might not be perfect, but you can use them together, and hopefully they add up.

Water cooling system which is basically a circulatory system. The heat is carried closer to the surface, and to areas which otherwise would not be producing much, if any heat, where some heat can dissipate in a way that would feel like body heat.

A "lung" like structure could be used to take in cold air, warm it in the lungs, and then breathe it out as hot air. The "lungs" can of course be anywhere in the body, in multiple locations that would allow them to collect a lot of heat, or which would get too hot and can't dissipate the heat through the circulatory system fast enough.

**In case of emergency overheating, the water in the circulatory system can be drained through the vagina. It simulates another lifelike function and adds to the verisimilitude. Just sit her on the toilet, maybe hook up a hose from the sink to her mouth to flush the entire system. You could make it flush out of a more accurate urethra, but flushing out of the vagina would also serve the purpose of cleaning it. From what I've heard of sex dolls and fleshlights, cleaning them is one of the worst parts.**

# 3
>>2535
Yes, you're right on track with the community here. These are ideas that have received broad approval here on /robowaifu/. For draining heat very quickly, you don't even have to have her sit on the potty. you can just hook one input to the water faucet, then have her drain the fluid out an outlet port down into the drain. This might be useful for example, after heavy **sexual** exertion.

Hopefully as our designs improve over the years these types of measures will be less needed, but for now it's a useful approach.

>you don't even have to have her sit on the potty. you can just hook one input to the water faucet, then have her drain the fluid out an outlet port down into the drain.
Well sure. But I figured a potty would be the easiest drain to access most of the time, while also adding verisimilitude. I guess you could use a bathtub or whatever just the same. Or maybe if you're in some basement dungeon **maybe our target audience** you would have drains right in the floor. Sure. Whatever you're into.

# 5
>>2539
No, it's a good idea. A urethra can be easily devised. Onaholes don't typically have ports for fluid plumbing as far as I know, so I think replaceable vagoo cartridges are more likely a better choice for today, hygiene-wise.

>Sure. Whatever you're into.
Heh, I meant the kitchen or bathroom sink. :^)

# 6
>>2540
Replaceable parts are a great idea all around, unless we're dealing with very cheap gynoids in the first place. I don't have a fleshlight, but don't at least some of them have holes on both ends, just only one end is usable? Just stick a hose on the inside end, the non-fucking end. Gotta wash it anyway. It's replaceable, but I think if you had to replace it every time, it might turn off more users than it gains. I also wonder which option would be cheaper for the average user, or which would at least be more attractive to prospective buyers.

# 7
>>2541
I dunno, never used one tbh. As you're probably well aware **(if you're who I think you are)** then economy pretty highly is important to start out with. We could engineer our own molds, or possibly even find vagoo designs specially fitted for flushing out. But in the meantime, cheap disposable cartridges seem to me our best bet in the interim.

# 8
>>2542
I'm sure someone on this board will be able to tell us if the one-time-use onaholes are cheaper in the long run than a reusable fleshlight. Fleshlights, of course, are still technically replaceable, if we used them as the robot's vagina. It's just a question of how many uses per dollar you get.

Method 1: liquid circulation
Coolant veins that absorb heat and then diffuse it into the skin or lungs which diffuse it back into the air. Could possibly be kept on the same track as the liquid in hydraulic muscles, if need be.

Method 2: air circulation
Similar to method one, but instead of pumping a liquid it would be pumping air. Less conductive, but could be integrated into pneumatic muscles and doesn't have the same risk of a coolant leak destroying hardware. An air circulatory system doesn't have to be limited to tubing either, more open spaces internally . A circulatory system would need a filter and dehumidifier though. Depending on if we want the entire thing to have skin or don't mind a more open design, sections like the forearm could be a mesh to allow for natural airflow in sections that aren't at risk of being damaged if not kept airtight.

Method 3: combination
It may be more effective to have an air based circulatory system that heats up a well insulated pouch of water as well as a sort of lung or skin that is kept away from anything particularly heat sensitive so that it can act as a heat sink and slowly dissipate the heat when temperature isn't as much an issue, such as times of inactivity.

Come to think of it, thermoelectric coolers would be an interesting idea if you could manage to vent the heat that it creates easily enough. As long as we are going with the idea of having an insulated area to act as a heatskink it would definitely be possible to combine that with a peltier cooler as long as the circulation and insulation was managed well enough.

# 11
For the more expensive and mb more human-like 
bots I'm going with the idea of using water to dissipate heat as body warmth. However, in that case we might rather need some heat. So if she's plugged in, she might even use some internal heater for stored water. A more advanced idea would be to get this heat also from sunbathing. Also, to store heat in a small salt "battery".
Another point is that electronics fail over time bc temperature fluctuations. So the goal should be to keep them at the same level most of the time.

The private parts in more advanced bots absolutely should be automatically cleaned with internal water, and such wastewater then being released in a human-like way.

# 12
>>4228
>Coolant veins
Aquarium tubing is probably pretty cheap purchased in reels.
>Similar to method one, but instead of pumping a liquid it would be pumping air
Yeah, we are ''definitely'' going to need internal air circulation. While not quite as effective as liquid heat absorption, air has the major benefit of near-zero daily maintenance, effectively inert reaction with components, and the ability to sneak into any accessible nook and cranny with only a bit of foresight in design planning. And as some Anon already pointed out, it will be nice to have your robowaifu's warm breath near you when you're sleeping together. :^)

Yes, we could do with a couple of thermoelectric sinks somewhere in the chest.

# 13
>>4229
We will definitely need to solve vagoo-cleaning protocols for robowaifus. Some of it can be automatic, but it would be nice if she can replace her own onahole cartridges, clean the used ones, and inform you/purchase herself when she needs new ones.

Lungs are a must for making the system as human as possible, but not a requirement for all designs.
However, as >>4237 pointed out, air circulation will be very valuable for getting into the places that a liquid coolant tube would not.
I wonder if it would be possible to use a thermoelectric cooler in a lung system so that the air and fluid internally could be cooled, while the cooler would disperse the heat into a sort of lung system using a heatsink or if just adding a filter, dropping the cooler, and combining the lung into a single structure would be better.

This would be, of course, in conjunction with trying to draw heat to the skin to disperse into the air. I wonder what the best kind of silicone would be for that.

# 16
>>4267
That is a very clever arrangement. Brillian, Anon. :^)

And thermo electric sinks have a hot side and a cold side. So, you'd place the cooling fins from the cold side in the intake->inside crossover to cool the outside air further, and the heating fins from the hot side would be in the inside->exhaust segment.

>I wonder what the best kind of silicone would be for that.
I expect there are industrial data sheets out there somewhere that give numbers on that exact topic.

# 17
>>4268
>thermo electric sinks have a hot side and a cold side
Right. I was thinking that the internal air and coolant tube in the left lung of the diagram could be kept completely closed in order to limit the need for a filter, while the right lung would just expand and contract in order to circulate out the hot air as it is dispersed by a heat sink. The left lung would probably need a fan to keep air flowing and a pump to keep the liquid flowing, but my concern is that one or even a few coolers may not be enough.

>I expect there are industrial data sheets out there somewhere that give numbers on that exact topic.
From what I can find, silicone is just a generally insulating material. There seem to be a few examples of heat spreading, which is very good, but none of them are elastic enough to be used as a skin. I don't see a better alternative to a silicone elastomer as skin, but given the low conductivity it could prove challenging.

# 18
>>4283
>I was thinking that the internal air and coolant tube in the left lung of the diagram could be kept completely closed in order to limit the need for a filter
I see, ofc that's a good idea. I forgot about that constraint.
>while the right lung would just expand and contract in order to circulate out the hot air as it is dispersed by a heat sink.
The more I think about this, the more I like the idea of devising a bellows arrangement. Not only can it be quite efficient mechanical-energy-wise, but it also will nicely mimic human breathing patterns. And that can only be a plus on cold, snuggly nights together with robowaifu. :^)
>The left lung would probably need a fan to keep air flowing and a pump to keep the liquid flowing, 
Yes, unless we can take advantage of the bellows mechanism for the airflow on that side as well. And the liquid might be able to gain by some sort of bladders around the robowaifu (that could ostensibly be used for padding, shape & form, etc) that could be passive pumping action by her day-to-day movements, etc. Probably would only serve as a small ancillary boost to the fluid pump's basic work, but every little helps. It will all need to be analyzed in the end for cost/benefit against the energy budget. But things like temporarily storing momentum inside rotating flywheels is well understood now, so we might find little bonus energy savings like that with a little clever exploration.
>but my concern is that one or even a few coolers may not be enough.
Probably not, unless it was a big honking one. Any information on the available plate sizes on these things Anon?

>From what I can find, silicone is just a generally insulating material.
Yeah, makes sense ofc.
>There seem to be a few examples of heat spreading, which is very good, but none of them are elastic enough to be used as a skin
Hmm, that's interesting. Since from a systems engineering perspective, we already need to solve differing surface materials with differing softness/resiliency then we might just be able to capitalize on that fact by judicious use of these materials. Can you provide more information on your findings here?
>I don't see a better alternative to a silicone elastomer as skin, but given the low conductivity it could prove challenging
Agreed.

Good post Anon.

# 19
>>4303
>bellows arrangement
The artificial lung system could probably be supported by a diaphragm type muscle that separates it from what would be the liver, stomach, and intestinal tract in a human. Considering the limited space for computation and other potential features, it might not be space efficient enough, but it is definitely an interesting idea. If the closed loop lung is hooked up with a couple valves it could possibly be used to naturally pump air through the air veins in the same way the heart pumps blood, but it probably isn't the most efficient system.
Technically, it may be possible to pump coolant in the same way we pump blood as well, but with a centrally located dedicated artificial heart.

>Any information on the available plate sizes on these things Anon?
The small ones are only about $3 each, but plate size doesn't seem to be as important as having a good heat sink. Without any sort of fan the things will overheat, so what seems to matter is more the transference of the heat. I gather that depending on the voltage applied, each side will have a difference of about 30 C. This does mean that if the device itself heats up too much the cold side will heat up along with the warm side, so venting that heat is a must. Unfortunately, even with a heat sink and a diaphragm it may not be enough to disperse the heat quickly enough, even for a single very small plate.

# 20
>>4334
>Considering the limited space for computation and other potential features
The general consensus (I think) is to house all the SBCs and other sensitive electronics in a 'breadbox' that would both serve as a cushioned hardshell for physical protection, and a Faraday-cage for RF protection. It also simplifies the cooling need for the computers as well.

So, I think some sort of central lever arm back near the spine, that spans the chest transversely, that slowly pumps two cylinders situated on either side of the central breadbox might be a feasible approach to have this bellows solution and still share the space with other components. Think sort of where our lungs are, but half the size and situated just inside our ribcage on the far right and far left of her chest.

>Technically, it may be possible to pump coolant in the same way we pump blood as well, but with a centrally located dedicated artificial heart.
Yeah, that's perfect. We need some sort of centralized thermal management core, probably just above the breadbox. That way the exchange of heat can be simplified by being near the 'lungs' and also directly adjacent to the breadbox (which will be a significant heat source).

>but plate size doesn't seem to be as important as having a good heat sink
That seems to suggest we have some honking big spun-aluminum fins situated on both the hot and the cold sides inside the central thermal mgmt core.

>Unfortunately, even with a heat sink and a diaphragm it may not be enough to disperse the heat quickly enough, even for a single very small plate
We can add a forced-air fan and vent heat directly out her upper back near the neck, as it will literally be 1 inch away from the core.

Hard to visualize without a diagram, but I think I get the picture. It could work, but without knowing how much heat will be produced from the various motors and electronics as well as how much heat can be dispersed with this method, I think it may be impossible to tell until a general model is made and tests are run. Really, as long as we can get a decent body made we can probably adjust the temperature needs once we have the limbs, muscles, and general torso blocked out.

# 24
> RF protection
 I had the same idea. However, premium models will need to use a lot of conductive material for sensors in the skin anyways, which might also help with heat dissipation. So it has a triple use, but will be expensive. 

> Breadbox
 I'm thinking of using air tanks in the head and/or upper chest. Computers would be inside or outside of these. Either way, using the heat to increase the pressure. Additional cooling should kick in if necessary. Tanks on the other side could use hot water from other areas to heat themselves up.

> 4283
What do you think about only having a thin skin of silicone/spandex on top, underneath conductive material like textiles with silver and underneath that, tubes with the hot water, maybe with some conductive connections to a higher layer.

How could we test stuff like that? Hot-water bottles are made out of silicone, I think. If we test  how much time it takes to cool a bit down, and compare it to a scenario in which there are other layers on top and heat can't go away to the side bc styrofoam? Then we would know a bit more.

# 25
>>4371
>How could we test stuff like that?
I guess buy a couple of water bottles, a heater, a thermometer, a stopwatch, and some styrofoam? No time like the present to run your own scientific experiments right?

# 26
>>4377
I thought about it a bit more, I might first need a thermometer with a water probe. Then, using only two flexible tubes glued side by side with a little distance between them. One side with four layers of thin textiles with a thin layer of silicone on top. The other sides need to be isolated much more. 
Of course, this doesn't account for new heat coming in. It will just show if the water cools down in a certain amount of time.
I'll try that in some time, don't know when, but it's on my mind.

Definitely. Heat pipes are extremely effective at bringing heat from one place to another. I don't think the robot could likely function without them. I guess the question is where they could be used most effectively.
Around the computation would be the most obvious of course, but there is the potential for their use generally in the torso. Shame there aren't any small flexible heat pipes, but is makes sense given the design.

# 31

They might help here and there with getting heat away from motors and batteries, not only computers. In the bigger ones heat cold be distributed over longer distances if we make the pipes part of some bones, which would also make them sturdier.

I think to have any reasonable shot at success, the waste heat will need to be piped directly into a central heat consolidator, and a single Stirling engine located attached to it. This might be enough heat to gain enough effective work to make it worthwhile. Of course, all the cooling systems for the robowaifu would also need to route directly there as well, whether liquid or air based. These things must have both a hot and a cold side to work at all.

# 40
I don't consider that to be a good idea, however he is building one: https://youtu.be/eZUteOLEKz8 - I'd rather use something like that externally to harvest solar thermic energy to gain electricity, and then one use cases would be charging robowaifus. So it's more of a prepper thing, or pushing alternatives to carbon based energy, and maybe for hiding huge energy consumption from the officials.

# 41
Insects have it better on cooling. Using exhaust ports for pushing hot air out. So we can probably have a dual system for passive and acrive cooling. Just put vents mainly at the core and at the limbs so when she passive cools you can feel heat as well.

# 42
>>9587
Dependent on the kind of build, there's a big vent - the mouth. Let's just use this one, or not? Also heat is usefull to be spread out throughout the outer shell which might be some kind of skin. Then it will radiate out, no extra holes required.

# 43
>>9587
>>9594
Certainly, all three forms of heat transfer ''conduction, convection (forced or otherwise), and radiation'' will all play a role in keeping our robowaifus cooled off. But Anon is right >>9585 if for no other reason than the loud noise associated with the mechanisms of the engine. I withdraw the suggestion, as far as in internal device in our robowaifus. :^)

>Electrically insulating and thermally conductive polymer matrix composites are desirable for industry applications as they improve the reliability of high-performance electronic devices, particularly via heat dissipation in devices loaded with several electronic components. In this study, an aggregated β-Si3N4 filler with randomly oriented grains was produced via combustion synthesis to improve the thermal conductivity of epoxy composites. The thermal conductivities of the prepared composites were investigated as a function of the filler content, and the values were compared to those of composites loaded with commercial β-Si3N4 (non-aggregated). Negligible difference was observed in the thermal conductivities of both types of composites when the Si3N4 content was below 40 vol%; however, above 40 vol%, the aggregated β-Si3N4 filler-loaded composites showed higher thermal conductivities than the commercial β-Si3N4-loaded composites. The aggregated β-Si3N4 filler-loaded composites exhibited isotropic thermal conductivities with a maximum value of 4.7 W m−1 K−1 at 53 vol% filler content, which is approximately 2.4 times higher than that of the commercial β-Si3N4-loaded composites, thereby suggesting that the morphology of the aggregated filler would be more efficient than that of the commonly used non-aggregated filler in enhancing the thermal conductivity of a polymer matrix composite.

The thicknesses, lateral dimensions, and aspect ratios of each filler material were intentionally selected for geometric similarity to one another, in contrast to prior studies that utilized dissimilar filler geometries to achieve a 'synergistic' effect. We demonstrate that the electrically-conductive graphene and electrically-insulating boron nitride fillers allow one to effectively engineer the thermal and electrical conductivities of their resulting composites. By varying the constituent fraction of boron nitride to graphene in a composite with ~44% total filler loading, one can tune the thermal conductivity enhancement from a factor of ×15 to ×35 and increase the electrical conductivity by many orders of magnitude. The obtained results are important for the development of next-generation thermal interface materials with controllable electrical properties necessary for applications requiring either electrical grounding or insulation.

I mean we could literally use Silicone oil now as its available at any hardware store. Obtaining graphene is not unreasonable, I think there's even a process for making it at home (I'll let you google this since there are so many results), and epoxy is also readily available (new age types use it to make those "orgone generators")

Now the tricky part, actually applying this. Personally I'd like to see a demonstration with a custom "flexible-pcb" bus linking a CPU to memory and ports (could be mini usb or usb C instead of standard), like an "uncrushable" raspberry Pi. Something that would flex if dropped rather than crack open. Then I would see how miniaturized we could get it, and surround it inside a mold with either the Silicone Oil inside of a bladder of sorts, or simply the epoxy with graphene and let it harden (with the ports exposed obviously) - from there, troubleshoot what goes wrong and try again.. repeat until successful.

Ofc, introducing liquids of any sort inside our robowaifus brings along some issues that need to be addressed. Leaks will be inevitable at one point or other, for instance. How should one deal with the cleanups for this? Seal maintenance, and reservoir/replenishments? Not attempting to dissuade any anon, but simply bringing up a few necessary points to address.

I've had this idea for a while now, but I was wondering how practical it'd be to run coolant around the body pumped by an artificial heart. I don't mean a real artificial heart, but back in the 60's there was a magazine article about how saltwater can be pumped with a railgun, using magnets perpendicular to the rails to boost the efficiency. I think this is what's used in molten salt reactors. Without any moving parts, you can circulate coolant around the body for realistic human body temperature and can mimic a heart beat sound in the chest just by pulsing the power to the rails instead of flat DC. The coolant would have to be electrically conductive unlike most PC coolants, where leakage could cause something to short, but it could be useful to transmit signals around the body. My biggest problem with the idea is that it needs to be non-toxic, and too much power could cause electrolysis, meaning it could produce either toxic or flammable gas and gradually dehydrate over time.

Leaking coolant from a small cut is also a problem if there's no good way to stop it.

Gladly. I only just learned (or re-learned, I might have forgot) about this board, so I've been posting a number of the things I've written and thought about to myself on this subject. I figure that the more I share, the more feedback I can get, but if nobody's interested enough to reply, I'll just put the idea away for later.

I forgot to mention the idea that the veins/coolant could possibly be used for infrared light piping if trying to use them as wire is impractical, or maybe serve as both. Due to the "Wiedemann-Franz law" thermal conductors are typically also electrical conductors, and it'd need to be electrically conductive for that railgun pump to work efficiently, so that works out pretty well. Off the top of my head colloidal silver or copper might be the best "robot blood" for this, but I'm sure there's probably some odd cocktail of ingredients that would do the job far better and cheaper, and hopefully without too strong a smell, or being mercury. I also like the idea of it mimicking the look of real human blood, if only because it could help with artificial skin complexion, with subsurface scattering and creating a pink flush/blush.

And now that I think about it I don't have much interest in hydraulics for actuators, but if there's already liquids being pumped around in the robot, then it might be worth considering using the robot blood as hydraulics fluid too. If only for the lady bits.

How salty would the water need to be?
>>13181
Okay, decent idea. However, please keep in mind we want the water not to damage the hoses inside, and being easily disposable through the bathtub or toilet. The materials should also be easiely available. Also, not being toxic or damaging if leaking. Last but not least, the idea was to use it for internal cleaning, so flusing other cleaning agents away, and maybe mixing it with alcohol (after using this one as disinfectant) so it can go into a ethanol fuel cell. Which would return acidic water which could still be usefull for flushing.

I assume this is for internal communication. I was thinking about using led lights for that but in glasfibers or something simpler. We have enough space for tubes and cables, I guess (dependent on the size/type of robowaifu).

>How salty would the water need to be?
That I don't know. It just needs to be conductive enough, which is why I mentioned colloidal silver and copper, which are relatively non-toxic, are electrical conductors and silver is usually used in heatsink thermal paste anyway. If it were saline made by adding sodium chloride to water, electrolysis could cause it to produce chlorine gas and hydrogen, which is why electrolysis is usually done with baking soda (sodium hydrogen bicarbonate) because it produces hydrogen & oxygen instead. It should be conductive, but need to avoid it being electrolyzed. I really don't know enough chemistry to know what ingredients would be best. All I could do is some brute force trial and error, which would be expensive and time consuming. I would, I mean it sounds kinda fun, but I don't have the time or money for that right now.

I don't like the idea of an ethanol fuel cell in general and don't think ethanol is really compatible with the railgun-pump idea for electrolysis reasons. I don't really like the idea of using the coolant for cleaning either. It should just stay in the body and circulate. Cleaning should be as simple as maybe some soapy water and that's probably not good for making the coolant I was going for. If it is, all the better, but I really doubt it.

>I assume this is for internal communication.
Yeah, I just figured that if the liquid were clear enough it could double as fiber-optics. I specified infrared because if the skin weren't perfectly opaque then light could shine through it, and you wouldn't notice it if it were IR. Unless you want strobe lights under the skin or something, but I don't.

I like the idea of using internal coolant directly as communications pathways, I admit that's a new idea to me. With the relatively short distances involved, and the absolute brightness of some types of LEDs, that signal degradation could basically be eliminated entirely as an issue for any relatively low-speed (say <= 1 Mbps) comms. Nice one Anon, thanks!

I would add that further, at the very least we should be able to use this approach as a sort of  "low-speed, back-channel & backup comms buss". BTW, do we have any thread here where exploring this idea further would be on-topic?

Glad you made it back Anon.

>I figure that the more I share, the more feedback I can get, but if nobody's interested enough to reply, I'll just put the idea away for later.
I would encourage you to post your ideas here, regardless of feedback. The board has slowly grown to be something of an archive of Anon's thoughts and concepts of robowaifus, and as such serves the interests of historical posterity at the least. Not that we're satisfied with just that of course! :^)

Point being, the 'traffic patterns' of IBs can be quite sporadic, even chaotic, and you never know who will pick up on a good idea at some point and have an 'aha!' moment. Factor in the future anons who will find us and the fact the board is actively archived in different ways, and you have a kind of ''robowaifu research library'' of sorts.

One I personally consider well worth investing into, regardless of approvals.

Oh, okay. So it seems to have some credibility. I'll download the PDFs then. Thanks.
