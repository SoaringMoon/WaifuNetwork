This is a rather important project for the people involved here. I just had this amazing idea, which allows us to catalogue and make any of the information here searchable in a unique way. It functions very similarly to an image booru, but for markdown formatted text. It embeds links and the like. We can really make this thing our own, and put the entire board into a format that is indestructible.



Anyone want to help build this into something great? I'll be working on this all day if you want to view the progress on GitHub.

Heh, I personally consider JSON to be about as 'indestructible' as they come for data OP. Feel free to use our board archives for Waifusearch as you see fit with your project. I'd also suggest you have a chat with Meta Ronin on the topic as well.

Cheers.

P.S. I'll leave this thread up as a stand-alone for now, but honestly it's more suited to our /meta threads. If you let this thread languish, then expect it to be merged there Anon.

That is fair, but this is a tagging system. Supplementary to the board archive, and unlike json; easily readable, storing inline images.

Addendum. It's not really a "board archive" project anyway. It is more of a "distilling useful content" from multiple sources kind of thing.

Obsidian is honestly one of the best ways to link and distill ideas into an easily digestible form. Great for helping new comers and returnees catch up to the current state of /robowaifu/. I would have really enjoyed having it when I returned as it took awhile to get caught up. Thanks for this SoaringMoon, hoping it will help others and bring in new comers.

I'm really interested to see how this will turn out.
