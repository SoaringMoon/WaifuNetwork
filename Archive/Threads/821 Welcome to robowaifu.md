==Why Robowaifu?==

Most of the world's modern women have failed their men and their societies, feminism is rampant, and men around the world have been looking for a solution. History shows there are cultural and political solutions to this problem, but we believe that technology is the best way forward at present – specifically the technology of robotics. We are technologists, dreamers, hobbyists, geeks **and robots** looking forward to a day when any man can build the ideal companion he desires in his own home. However, not content to wait for the future; we are bringing that day forward. We are creating an active hobbyist scene of builders, programmers, artists, designers, and writers using the technology of today, not tomorrow. Join us!

==What is a Robowaifu?==

That's a very good question! A robowaifu is a robot that fulfills a man's natural need for companionship. To achieve this, there are many problems to be solved, and there are many approaches being explored here. Solutions range from silicone sex dolls with robotic features to VR and virtual girlfriends, and even into the realm of spirituality.

==Do You Intend to Sell Robowaifus?==

The objective is to design a robowaifu that any man can create in his own home. We also believe in open source as a way to protect our rights. We expect that some day companies will sell robowaifu kits. Already there is one company that sells a complete robowaifu, that company being RealDoll, the robowaifu being named Harmony.

==What do You Think About RealDoll's Harmony?==

RealDoll is a company that sells highly realistic silicone sex dolls. Recently, they have started selling what we would call a robowaifu, named Harmony. This is the first robowaifu to come to market. We wish them well, but most on this board have objections to the approach. Firstly, she is expensive, costing about $10,000, out of range for most men. Secondly, she is deep into the uncanny valley, the place where human-imitating technologies go to die. Thirdly, the range of designs are quite limited, and every man has a different ideal woman.

To avoid dealing with the uncanny valley and for other reasons, we believe that a customizable, neotenous, non-realistic (possibly animal-like) alternative is in order. We believe that robowaifus can be made cheaper and more available. And we believe that a DIY hobbyist scene would be more resistant to threats such as corporate surveillance, angry feminists with the government's ear, and traditionalist morality police looking for an easy victory.

==How Much Would a Kit Cost?==

It's unclear at the moment. RealDoll's Harmony is $10,000, which is out of range for most men. On the other hand, a robotic pet such as a Furby costs $40. Therefore, robowaifus will range between $40 and $10,000. Unless you have a Furby-fetish, you're unlikely to get anything satisfying for less than $300, and a kit is unlikely to be economically successful for over $2,000. Therefore, a DIY robowaifu will probably range between $300 and $2,000.

==How Customizable Will Robowaifus be?==

Open source designs will enable unlimited customization. To some extent you will be limited by your own artistic talent, although men without art skills should be able to find a wide variety of premade designs to meet their needs. We have seen the ability of the internet to fulfill all sorts of crazy niches and fetishes, so don't expect anyone to be disappointed – except roasties!

==Who can Contribute?==

We need a variety of talents. Obviously engineers and programmers, but also artists, designers, and even writers. And of course literally anyone can freely voice their opinions here, so please join in.
