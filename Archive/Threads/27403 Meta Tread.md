Off-topic and general discussion thread. 

Also, let's discuss ways to get more people involved. How can we grow this board? 

Also, let's share robowaifu media to help inspire each other. This is a very generalized thread meant to improve robowaifu in general.

# 2
It's nice to see that this place finally has a proper bunker up and running.



I'm the greentext writer that flooded the agalmatophilia thread with my alternate history stories.

I have everything saved on my computer. Should I repost in the agalmatophilia thread as tradition dictates, or should I put everything in the fiction thread?

# 3
>>44
Welcome back.
>or should I put everything in the fiction thread?
If you wouldn't mind put it where it rightly belongs into the fiction bread. Have you completed anything new lately?

# 4
>>46

Makes sense, I'll be putting them up shortly.

Unfortunately, I still haven't made much progress on the latest story. As of now, it's 184 lines, and nowhere near done. If I had to give a percentage, I'd say it's ~5% completed.

While progress has been unforgiveably slow, I've recently gotten that ''itch'' to write again, which means I'll be doing ''something'' new soon.

I should also take this opportunity to note that the random bits of poetry and unrelated short stories I've damned your eyes with haven't been saved **except The Return of Dead Hill, which I still have the original physical document for**, so naturally I won't be posting those.

# 5
>>48
>so naturally I won't be posting those.
Ehh, post what you like. As long as you aren't promoting feminism or cocksucking here on the board, do what you like. Based on your work from before I highly doubt you're going to do either of those.

One of the nice things is you can ''collaborate'' here, which means you don't have to wait until things are completed you know. Just post whatever you feel like writeanon.

# 6
>>48

Wow I'm retarded.

I just checked the folder again, and it turns out I ''do'' have a couple of the extras, including the original Dead Hill. So I guess I'll be posting those as well.

>>49

Yeah, I'd sooner die than go that way.

I'll contribute to things wherever I feel I can help, as I did on the last board. For whatever it ends up being worth, I'll give what I can where I can.

# 7
>>70
>I'll give what I can where I can
Can't rightly ask a man for more than that tbh.

# 8
Regardless of the eventual outcome of creating desirable robowaifus, let's just try to keep each other encouraged through the process, deal?

# 9
Continuing what I was saying in the "selecting a programming language" thread, I'd like to know how many of us made it to the Bunker. I recall there being a Mexican anon as well a flip one. Where are you guys? If you are here, please speak up.

# 10
>>162
The boards list says there are 6 users in the current sliding window for /robowaifu/. I only post via TOR and I'm not sure if it's even counted, probably not.

# 11
>>162
Did anyone actually see Alita Battle Angel in the theaters? I did twice.

>also
**those '3-white' eyes tho**

# 12
>>163

>>163

That great to hear. I'm glad we have more people here than expected. Even if they are just lurkers. 

>>164

No. I will consider watching it. 

>spoiler

What? What about the 3-white? I have no idea what you're talking about. Sorry.  



/robowaifu/, What would you do if you saw your robowaifu doing what is shown in webm 2? Would you help her or record her then bring it up at the dinner table? or maybe... %% Post it to /robowaifu/ for all your /robowaifu/ friends to see and laugh about?%%

# 13
>>165
Kekd. I would tactfully offer to help her then never mention it again. :^)

>also
'3-whites' is a slang for yandere. That Hatsune Miku robowaifu has dangerously **murderous** 3-white yandere eyes anon.

# 14
>>167

I feel like a massive new fag. I have never heard this term before. I'm sorry. 



/robowaifu/, What is your religion, if any?

# 15
>>168
>I'm sorry.
lol, who gaf about silly shit like that anon.

ofc there is no '/robowaifu/' as a singular collective (if you'll pardon the oxymoron). we are all individuals. we are obviously a bunch of Westerners and Christianity has been the dominant traditional 'nominal' religion in the West for pretty much all of it's history. me personally, i'm a born-again Christian who actually believes that Jesus Christ is God and that every human will see Him face to face.

# 16
>>169

Thanks for you answer. When I say "/robowaifu/" I am addressing the board and anyone using it. Are you the same guy i was talking to last night? how's your college going? What are you planning on doing with your degree if you don't mind sharing. 

webm semi related, it's probably what I am going to be doing in the future.

# 17
>>170
YW.
>Are you the same guy i was talking to last night? how's your college going?
I assume so yes. I'm up again very late. As far as my degree goes, I figure I'll find a good job and pay the bills. Eventually I want to start my own company, maybe making animations, maybe making robowaifus, maybe even both somehow.

>that webm
Sweet, I really enjoyed that tbh. Do you have the sauce on it anon?

# 18
>>171

>>171

Yeah I do. https://anidb.net/anime/406  

Seems interesting. I think I'll give it a watch some time.

# 19
>>172
Thanks. Would you mind telling me the name of the show please? anidb doesn't allow TOR.

# 20
It's nice to see that there are more than just three people here. Hopefully we'll get all of our original userbase back one way or another.



>>168

I've never really subscribed to any religion, or even proper atheism.

Whenever I ponder this topic, the only conclusion I can reach is "I don't know", and it'll probably stay that way unless I get some divine revelation.

# 21
>>174

Okay. Thanks for the answer. Do you think there's a possibility that some of the /robowaifu/ community aren't aware of the bunker on julay world?

>>173

It is called "Kachou Ouji: Hard Rock Save the Space"

# 22
>>176
>It is called "Kachou Ouji: Hard Rock Save the Space"
Thanks anon. Not that anon, but no, I don't think most anons know about this bunker yet. It's only 4 days old.

# 23
>>177

No problem. I reposted the link to the bunker in the robot thread on /monster/ again. I might consider posting it on /cuckquean/ as well.

I don't think /clang/ has a bunker, do they?

# 24
>>174
>Hopefully we'll get all of our original userbase back one way or another.
Yes, that would be fun tbh.

# 25
>>179
Good. I'll try emailing my old contact from a year ago. Maybe he's still around.
>I don't think /clang/ has a bunker, do they?
I haven't heard of one, no.

# 26
>>179
>I might consider posting it on /cuckquean/ as well.
IIRC they had two outstanding robowaifu threads on their board. They took it seriously too and really discussed the idea of being cucked by a beautiful young robowaifu.

# 27
>>181

>email contact

Sometimes when this shit comes I feel like we are members of a military force that was defeated and now we must go into the deep wilderness and fight an effective guerrilla warfare campaign against a superior force.

>>182

Damn, 2? I posted something there about them buying one for their bfs but I guess they really like that idea. They often propose them as "submissive vixens". Despite them being women, do you see them as trustworthy allies of /robowaifu/?

# 28
>>183
>and fight an effective guerrilla warfare campaign against a superior force.
I think that's always been the case for IBs, when you consider the likes of the numbers at normalfag shit like faceberg, and twatter.

(((Our enemies))) were themselves were reeling like drunkards when Trump stole their plot to put that demon woman in charge, and this latest set of redflags to take down 8chan is still just a part of their retaliation for that.

>cuckquean breads
Long threads with hundreds of posts too, so I'd say there's a sizable number, yeah. But they are in no way technical so their support is more of a 'moral' **if such a thing is possible in that case heh** and emotional POV.

# 29
>>183
just to clarify, i meant their 8 board ofc.

# 30
>>185

>>184

Yes, I didn't think they had any other boards besides their one on bunkerchan.

# 31
>>186
They had a very well-established board on 8/cuckquean, and the two threads I mentioned were several hundred posts in length each. The first one actually hit the limit which I think was set at 550 posts max iirc.

My point being, there is a real interest there, if their community ever regathers itself.

# 32
A question to the BO, what will happen to /robowaifu/ when 8chan comes back up? Will /robowaifu/ go back to 8chan?

# 33
>>188
BO here. So I hadn't really decided. For certain, I won't just 'pull the plug' on either place. I'll just create a sticky over on 8 pointing to the bunker here and ppl can come here or no. Everyone who cares will find out about the various bunker boards sooner or later anyway IMO.

In the meantime, we will keep in mind that we are guests here on Julay, and act accordingly.

# 34
Hello /robowaifu/! I saw your greetings to us on anoncafe/cuckquean/ and thought I'd come visiting. You have built yourselves back up very quickly in such a short time, I'm impressed.

>>182
>IIRC they had two outstanding robowaifu threads on their board. They took it seriously too and really discussed the idea of being cucked by a beautiful young robowaifu.
>>183
>They often propose them as "submissive vixens". Despite them being women, do you see them as trustworthy allies of /robowaifu/?
We had two AI/robotic cuckqueaning threads that started from the surprisingly deep question:
>Can women be cucked by robots?

Our deliberations covered a great many things but focused particularly on AI and on what it would take to create an AI that we could schlick to our boyfriends fucking, developments in human-focused AI, non-robowaifu AI manipulation of humans, physical engineering of pleasing robot girls, roboaesthetics, and so on.

>>184
>But they are in no way technical so their support is more of a 'moral' if such a thing is possible in that case heh and emotional POV.
I won't comment. Suffice to say that we know enough to speculate intelligently on the problems you're likely to encounter.

>>186
>bunkerchan
We're on anon.cafe. Bunkerchan is the name of /leftypol/'s bunker site.

>>187
I do hope we can regather. It was so much fun. Apparently we have all our old content archived but there's the question of where and when we want to resurrect it.

>//-------------
==sorry that last image was a bit too suggestive for the modern sjw-infested workplace, luv. sfw board and all that you know.==

# 35
>>216
Hello /cuckquean/, welcome. Hope your community finds it's way back together, either on the bunkers or elsewhere.

Thanks for your clarifications on the threads in question and the breadth of topics you discussed in them. I would certainly enjoy reading such a thing if your community ever recreates such a discussion again. 

Thanks for stopping by, your input here is welcome. Social aspects of devising and owning robowaifus are also of high concern to our community ofc. Having women actually buy them for their husbands and boyfriends would add an interesting twist to this market.

Come over anytime.

# 36
>>216

Hello /cuckquean/! I'm the same person here and here >>183 >>186

Coincidentally, I'm also the same person on /monster/ who wrote this and posted the greeting on /cuckquean/. 

Anyways, Thanks for stopping by. 

To explain why I was concerned with /cuckquean/ being trust worthy is because well, you are women. As you could have determined yourself, women are hated and down right vilified on /monster/ and /robowaifu/. People aren't trust worthy of women because of the shit they've pull in the past. However, both /robowaifu/ and /monster/ really seem to vouch for you. I hope you can understand why I held such caution towards you and your fellow bicorns. With all that being said, you seem like worthy allies of /monster/ and /robowaifu/. I am sorry if it came out like I was trying to D&C.

Also I have a couple of questions for you myself. How many posters are there on /cuckquean/? Here on /robowaifu/ I would guess we have around 3-5 posters. When I made my post on /cuckquean/ it took around 3 days to get a reply. Is it because no one found it interesting, I came off as rude%% are you bicorns really that sensitive? %%, or there are just not enough bicorns on your board? 

Also would you unironically buying your bf/husband a robowaifu?

# 37
>>218
>women are hated and down right vilified
Not on /robowaifu/ anon. This isn't /r9K/. Feminism is the problem. Any woman who promotes feminism is most definitely '''not''' welcome here and will be banned on sight. /cuckquean/ gals seem much more laid back, accepting and even embracing their roles as females. I like them.

# 38
>>219
>Any individual, female or male*

# 39
>>219

Sorry, perhaps I misinterpreted this line of text from the pinned thread "Welcome to /robowaifu/" 

>Modern women have failed their men and their societies, and men around the world have been looking for a solution.

# 40
>>222
That statement and yours do not necessarily conflate anon. One is a factual observation, one is not.

# 41
>>223

I understand now. Thanks for telling me. Perhaps it would be even more insidious to hate women as a whole as it would be giving into what the kikes want. 

D&C is the Jews' greatest weapon.

# 42
>>224
Just so, good point anon.

# 43
>>224
I will amend the text of the opener in the Welcome bread to reflect that it's not every.single. woman. Thanks for helping me to realize that issue anon.

# 44
>>224

>>225

But it's hard to not hate all women when you see shit like this. I know this isn't every woman's opinion but damn it makes me angry. /cuckquean/, What do you think of this image and what are your opinions on abortion in general?

 

To everyone in this thread in your opinion, how many women are as bad as the woman featured in the image I have posted? I live in the USA so could you give me a percentage of how many are unlikable whores who hate all women?



%% Regardless of the answer, this still won't change my mind of robowaifus. I would much rather have a robotic waifu than a 3d woman. %%

# 45
>>227

>I live in the USA so could you give me a percentage of how many are unlikable whores who hate all women? 

I meant to say...

I live in the USA so could you give me a percentage of how many are unlikable whores who hate all men?

Whoops.

# 46
>>227

>>228

The US is a big place, so it'd be nearly impossible to come up with an accurate figure.

In my state, I'd say it's somewhere in the neighborhood of ~60%, and a good chunk of that is toothless. This figure becomes far less optimistic if you focus on certain regions or generations. (Where I live, much of the population is quite old, and are thus dwindling in power and influence. For better or worse, the situation of my state will change drastically over the next 10 years or so)

Anyone who lives in a city, of course, is going to see a much worse outlook than someone who lives in a rural region in many cases, and even this may vary from region to region. The generational gap is also something that can't be ignored, ''especially'' in the US.



Feminism takes many forms across many areas and generations. The only thing that remains the same is the solution.

# 47
>>227
The kind of murdering extremists like the women posting in your pic are definitely in the minority. The group of women willing to murder babies at ''all'' is a larger percentage, but still a minority even when the act itself is provided for them entirely free of charge by the state.

While evil cunts like the ones you present are definitely ''a'' problem, they don't really represent the bulk of '''the''' problem IMO. They're just the loud-mouth harpies who are a small minority. The majority of the the problem--particularly in the West--comes from what I would say are the females who are now brainwashed from birth that all men are evil, and secretly buy into the idea that all men should be disobeyed. This sin is as old as the human race anon; 'There's nothing new under the Sun' after all. The problem is that today the brainwashing has been amped up to 11 by the kikes in control of the media, and the complicit ZOG system happily rakes men over the coals to enforce this gynocentric evil.

This tacit acknowledgement by modern women of the (((feminist))) indoctrination hidden in their hearts has destroyed families by the bushel-load, and is rapidly leading to the utter destruction of the entire Western Tradition by serving as the primary gateway drug to most of the other evil, modern '-isms' out there.

>tl;dr
It's not a cut and dried situation anon, and each female is a specific case. But the majority would dearly hate the introduction of robowaifus, for example, due the the threat to their powerbase it would represent.

# 48
>>216
>You have built yourselves back up very quickly in such a short time, I'm impressed.
Trust me, it's fueled by ''PureAutism™, now in more great flavors!''

# 49
Odd how active the bunkers are. Even the smaller boards get more traction despite 8chan being dead. Even /kind/ is alive again. Maybe this is some 2014 revivalism?

# 50
>>236
>Maybe this is some 2014 revivalism?
Heh, could be who knows. An anon over on anon.cafe/cafe remarked how they felt like we were all neighbors in a big forest now, having to keep in better touch with our neighbors.

I think if this upheaval just gets less mature anons that they can just step up and be the future they imagine, then lots of the smaller boards might in fact prosper out of all of this.

The second part is the 'big fish in little pond vs. little fish in big pond' phenomenon. Better visibility in the dynamics and watnot.

At least that's my take on it anon.

# 51
>>238
>if this upheaval just gets less mature anons to only realize that*

# 52
>>229
>The only thing that remains the same is the solution.
anonler was right.

# 53
>>236 

>>238

Yeah that's basically what it is. I like to see 8chan as a great city of autism. When it ended, the anons of that city had to retreat into the the forest to survive. The most resourceful anons were able to survive and thus the highest quality of posters. It's kind of like what I said about fighting a guerilla war against a superior force. 

So far, what has been everyone's favorite part of being in their respective bunkers?

# 54

>So far, what has been everyone's favorite part of being in their respective bunkers?

I like the B2 scene and the camping pic, but why did you shoop Batman into a mountain?

# 59

# 60
>>281

Do you think it's even worth it to bring back 8chan? There are a few people on /monster/ who said they don't want to return to 8chan due to glow niggers. /cuckquean/ just outright said they are abandoning 8chan. 



Also I've probably asked this question before but does any one know where /just/ went? I really miss them and their games they would play with the dice roll. It basically was where you roll 5 dice with 100 sides and if you got 490 or above you have just unfucked brendan's shit but also everyone else's shit on /just/. It was really fun and i miss it.

>>163

I meant to ask you this earlier but why do you have to use TOR to post? Do you live in a hostile country that would consider this website a bad thing? %% You don't have to tell me if you don't want to. I understand if you can't %%  

>>285

Yes, yes, I see it.

# 61
>>286
Hmm, well for us personally, Robi has made no promises I'm aware of to keep Julay going indefinitely. His expenses don't sound too high atm, but they could grow. Also, he might just say "fuck it, move on" and no fault to him for that. So I think that the imageboard life from now on needs to be a nomadic one, ready to pull up stakes and move on at the drop of a hat. Consider Jim pulling the plug on 8chan--whether temporarily or permanantly--as a wake up call to the wider community of anons: "Out here, assholes, you keep your shit wired tight at all times!"

# 64

cute. those two should be added to a 'robowaifu voice assets' collection. the first one in your previous post gave me a good laugh.

So, that gets me to thinking that maybe we should begin working on some kind coordinated asset repository. Obviously we should just start out with a thread for it I'd think but it probably needs to be something more accessible in a distributed fashion later. Think of a production pipeline for a distributed studio. Anyone from around the world has access to a private intranet of resources.

# 65

Right. Would you like me to return to that discord and attempt to find the previous owner? Also if I do, should I tell them about /robowaifu/?

# 66

Do as you see fit anon. This board has built-in anti-cancer power all on it's own, so we're not going to be overrun regardless. **However leading them back here to ''Julay'' and the ''webring'' may be a different matter. :^)**

# 67

I don't want to create unnecessary  casualties. There was a discord server that is friends with /monster/, the /ebola/ Discord. I'll go there and ask if anymore has been made. If I can get a response, I'll report back here.

# 71
>>296
Very nice. You are a man of many talents. How's the studies going? I had previously considered creating some kind of tutorial pages to teach any interested anons how to code in C++, but it turned out code tags didn't work on statics back on 8. They're also a problem here. Now I figure I might as well start a /robowaifu/ wiki somewhere and part of that can be a robowaifu-oriented coding boot camp after some fashion. 

Ideas on this anyone?

# 72
>>296

I want to learn C++ but I am currently taking a college class that has me learning javascript for web design. It's a pretty fun class and the teacher is pretty cool too.

# 73
>>298
I see, JavaScript is a pretty great language actually. I'd recommend you dig deeply into Node.js on your own after this class. Lots of job opportunities.

While we won't be using JavaScript inside a robowaifu, still it's a better language to start with than Python tbh. Slightly less 'just believe in magic anon!' issues.

If you ever want to learn how JavaScript actually does what it does, the source is all open:

If you do decide to make a /robowaifu/ wiki, please don't make it on wikia. That site fucking sucks. Also do you have enough money to run your own website? That would be cool. I will be graduating from college soon and I might be able to help you pay for it since I will be moving to the south soon.

# 76

>If you do decide to make a /robowaifu/ wiki, please don't make it on wikia. That site fucking sucks. 
Fair enough. I have no particular preferences apart from potential backlash from '''"Won't someone please just think of the children!"''' harpies creating drama over dem ebil nahtzee pedo robowaifus. Any recommendations, what do you think of wikidot?

>Also do you have enough money to run your own website? That would be cool. I will be graduating from college soon and I might be able to help you pay for it since I will be moving to the south soon.
Actually, I'm in school so money's pretty tight atm. There's also the issue of anonymity. If someone can help me figure out how to start a domain anonymously, yet still retain full de facto legal control over it, I would create an official /robowaifu/ hub for us on the web in a heartbeat. And thanks kindly for the offer anon, who knows?

>>302
>How long do you think it would take me to learn to use C++?
In the business world, the standard is that it takes someone 2 years to become good at their jobs. C++ is a ginormous language, so somewhat longer, I'd say. But I can have you writing and running the basics--enough for you to start taking other people's code apart so you can learn on your own--in one hour.

# 77
>>297

I haven't really dived into C++ just yet, and I still need to pick out an IDE. College takes up quite a bit of my time and energy. I will have most of tomorrow free though, and I'll be using most of that time to take my first real dive into learning the language.

>>298

Nice, there are a lot of career opportunities in being a web designer. Personally, I've decided to take the path of the sysadmin. I've only recently begun college, so my current instructor is going to have us learn Python, which I have some prior experience with. Of course, later down the line I'll probably have to get into more complicated stuff, so learning C++ now will give me a huge head-start.

# 78
That's funny, all 3 of us seem to be in Uni right now.

>>304
>and I still need to pick out an IDE
If you can manage to choke down learning tmux+vim, then you'll be set literally for life. And since you are apparently going for sysadmin **as am i tbh** then it's an absolute no-brainer as well. vi is available on every.single. *NIX system ever. Highly recommended.

I don't drink beer unless I'm being given a free one. My go-to drink is usually vodka.

# 86

It may be better to learn a little C first, especially in the context of embedded or real-time systems. From there you can move to C++ as an elaboration, but doing C++ first may end up becoming a crutch for you.

# 87

Do you only prefer scotch or do you also like beer?

>does anyone visit the gym

Gym's gay, I workout at home by lifting my textbooks and history books, totals about 50-70 pounds with different sets. Bodyweight also builds more strength than resistance training, ironically. Opportunity abound, I post guide.

>>358 

>Any particular reason?

Working out makes ur brain werk gud, gives you a keen view of aesthetics, promotes a positive view of yourself (which is ridiculously important in the factor of love - one cannot love another without first loving themselves. Doesn't matter how or with who.) Also, being the best version of yourself means no ragrets later in life, including your more long-lasting choices (such as marrying an artificial, immortal being).

I liked your gachimuchi parody. I thought the gesture was very sweet.

>With all that being said, you seem like worthy allies of /monster/ and /robowaifu/. I am sorry if it came out like I was trying to D&C.
I can't speak for everyone on /cuckquean/, but I'm not opposed to your efforts here. I found the general feminist media reaction to robowaifus puzzling. It comes off as a little pathetic. Imagine being such a narrow person that you're threatened by a robot? It's like being threatened by a hand. I am a little worried by possible effects on birthrates but I think there are much larger problems there and that robot companions won't affect it much compared to other factors. The effects of industrialising sex and companionship also have worrying implications for the maintenance of the human spirit, but there are also much larger threats to that.

The ambition of the whole effort is admirable, even though you have a long way to go and much to learn. I like that you're determined to try to make this self-contained and open-source instead of allowing huge corporations to hold your robowives on their server farms. Any thumb in the panopticon's eye is a good one in my opinion.

>How many posters are there on /cuckquean/?
We lost a lot. We tended to attract a lot of posters who only visited from time to time, so it's hard to put a number on our "regulars" count. Many of our posters didn't know about our first bunker and I suspect we lost a lot more by not having our proper bunker ready before Endchan went down.  At the moment I recognise about four other anons who've made it to the bunker. When I think about those who clearly needed /cuckquean/ as an outlet for discussing what is a very poorly-understood fetish even in kinky circles, I really hope they'll find their way back to us.

>there are just not enough bicorns on your board?
Yep, considering the above. Or maybe we're just too used to watching.

>would you unironically buying your bf/husband a robowaifu?
It's interesting how much this question reveals about the fetish. The only way I can see it working is if she was a true individual AI who could exist independently of her body, which is a whole different problem set to what you're working on here. Otherwise she'd just seem to me like a fancy onahole.

>>227
I don't think my opinion is going to be different from any other normal person: The posters in the image are mentally ill. I don't think expressing my opinions on abortion here will be valuable even if, for example, they end up aligning with yours.

>>229
Something has gone wrong. There's a deep self-denying sickness in the United States and it's getting worse. The people and ideas I see coming from there are getting fundamentally crazier. I think the United Kingdom has also caught the malaise. People talk endlessly about how to fix it but I think the best thing to do is to pull what you can from the wreckage and to live as apart as you can. It's possible to live a good life anywhere. Maybe the Amish will be okay. I respect them a lot.

>>238
>An anon over on anon.cafe/cafe remarked how they felt like we were all neighbors in a big forest now, having to keep in better touch with our neighbors.
I saw that as well. It's comfy. It's also why I've come back to visit again.

>>286
>/cuckquean/ just outright said they are abandoning 8chan. 
We're not the only ones who're following that plan. We're not really abandoning as such, just moving to a satellite. I've seen anons express doubts as to our survival if we do this and perhaps they're right, but what they forget is that /cuckquean/ has always moved glacially most of the time with occasional bursts of furious activity. As long as our 8chan board isn't seized and the link to our new home erased, I think we'll do okay. I love the exodus diaspora spirit, yet we're for cuckqueans first and anons second if that makes sense.

if you mean the development of robowaifus, then outside of school I work on honing my skills as a developer. I'm also focused on getting the board back together for everyone. I just wrote a little utility for that effort that let's me know where to get the most return for effort.

# 128
Heads up. It seems like the /ebola/ BO made a bunker over on smug since a lot of their users were on /monster/, which is also on smug.

# 129
>>595

>/ebola/ BO

I should clarify that BO referred to the BO back on 8chan, not just the BO of the bunker board.

# 130
So, back on 8ch, I (and then another anon afterwards) tediously went through and archived each thread on /robowaifu/ one by one by hand on the archive.today service. I'm not vain about the board but I recognized that atp in time, /robowaifu/ is truly unique among IBs, and I wanted to preserve that information for everyone including myself. Accordingly, after creating all the archives, I made an archive thread for the board users (which should be repopulated here as well, according to my plans. >>273) and published all the archive links there. I also made local copies. 

The decision to keep these various backups of the board was, quite frankly, the only reason the original board is more or less being **slowly** fully restored here on the julay.world bunker site today. I certainly wouldn't have bothered with it otherwise, and if 8ch doesn't in fact come back up, then all that information would have been lost.

So, in an effort to streamline this whole thing for the future, I'm working on an 'automated archiver' that will scrape the URLs of all the threads off the board, go and create archives on archive.today, then make a thread post up on the board--all automatically. I plan to just run it locally as a cron job probably once every couple of days to pick up any new posts that are made.

If I get it working properly, then I'll release the source publicly so other BOs can keep their boards archived just as easily. Wish me luck!

I'd recommend looking at what the VoatArchive bot does on Bitchute for archiving videos that get posted to Voat. It could also be used to backup the webm/mp4 files that get posted here.



https://www.bitchute.com/channel/voatarchive/?showall=1

An added benefit is that it would help with outreach. I'd try to get in contact with the guy who made it, there's been good relations between Voat and 8ch so he might share.

Here: The '''Baphomet'''.



In a shaker over ice, pour:

6cl Tequila

3cl Mango Juice

Splash of Triple Sec (e.g. Cointreau)

Splash of Lime Juice



Shake and strain straight up. Into the very middle of the drink, drop a maraschino cherry together with a touch of the maraschino cherry liquid. Add a splash of home-made grenadine to the very middle of the drink. Allow the grenadine to rise a little through the drink, then serve.

The webring addon checks every 30 minutes to update its board listing. Since smug has been down for more than 30 minutes, the update found smug was down, so it was removed from the listings.

What board and thread did you see it on? I know someone posted it in the 5th anniversary thread on /monster/. If you are unaware, the drink is meant to be consumed by a loli monster girl who is basically the face of lolis in that universe. That's where its name comes from. The girl in question is called a Baphomet. I was never personally a fan of it due to her demonic connections but she's cute nonetheless and there are a lot of memes associated with her. She's also KC's favorite girl as well as Aux's.

Alright, I've got the scraper part basically working now. Seems like it's pretty fast too so that's nice. There's still plenty of work left before it's a full-on archive bot, but this is enough to go on with for the moment. I'm thinking of naming the project 'ArchBot' . I have some ideas for all the features I'd like to have in a complete IB archiving system, but I'm open to new ideas or requests as well ofc.

I'm creating a post with the current julay/robowaifu archives on the threads archive bread. >>273 Maybe it's still too early to be making archives for the bunker but ehh w/e I was going to do it eventually anyway and there's a bit of new content already. Later I'll add another set of posts on the archives thread that consolidates all the archive links from 8ch/robowaifu, hopefully with updates from after 8ch comes back up **:^)**

# 154
>>659

As the other anon who did the second archive by hand I'm glad this process is now automated.



I was going to do a third archiving of /robowaifu/ back when there were signs that 8chan was going to have trouble with cloudflare but archive.today wasn't working properly for me at the time. I still have personal backups though, I could turn them into pdfs and upload them here if you're interested.

# 155
>>661
thanks anon, much appreciated for the work from before. so, let's hold off and see if Jim Watson & Son come through. I'm poised ready to strike to update all the archives and to grab new local copies if & when it comes back up. i'll also immediately put a link here to the julay bunker on the 8ch/robowaifu board announcement.

We'll see.

# 156
>>661
on second thought, I'm not certain of my schedule for the next couple of weeks i may be offline for a while, so in case i miss the (likely temporary) revivication of 8ch in time to grab new archives, maybe you can get those files zipped and saved somewhere just in case anon?

# 157
>>663

They're on another computer and I'm busy this week but I'll try and post them here this weekend. Compressing all of the pages will be a lot less work on my end than saving each thread as a pdf so if there's an anonymous file hosting site you can recommend I'll use that.

# 158
>>664
Yeah, I'd say just compressing the files would be fine--maybe even better than pdfs. 
>if there's an anonymous file hosting site you can recommend I'll use that.
honestly, I'm not sure. i know i've been able to ''download'' big files from mega.nz, but as far as posting goes, i'm not sure. i can ask on /tech/ and see if anyone can help, but they are pretty slow still here on the bunker.

there's no rush anon, i merely realized i might miss the chance to update all the old archive links from 8ch so that's what made me reconsider your offer.

Last night, JulayWorld went down. Is everyone okay? Chobitsu, Do you know what happened? I was concerned because I thought someone on /cow/ had done something to the wrong person and they were coming for JulayWorld. It turns out it was just a technical error but I'm not entirely sure of specifics of what happened. Anyways, for anyone who is reading this, if an incident like this happens again, regrouping at cafe in the Julay.world is down thread would be the proper course of action. 

https://anon.cafe/cafe/res/362.html

# 168

# 169
>>984

You can make yourselves a bunker there as well, /k/ has done this in case Julay goes down for good.

# 170
>>984
>>986
A) Calm down. We have nearly complete archives from before at 8ch, and ''full'' archives of here at Julay. This is why you need to keep the latest archive directory link at privatebin bookmarked locally in your browser. Whenever you see the archive thread at the top of the catalog, it means a recent update has been posted to the archives directory page. E.G., here's the current one:
>>937
I'll shortly be doing full, unsorted dumps of julay/robowaifu at catbox.moe as well. Keep an eye on that same archive page for the links when I do so.

B) With all the effort I'm putting in laboriously restoring the threads by hand, do you think I'll just let this board die so easily? Even if Julay goes down in the future **(it will)** we'll just regroup somewhere else. I noticed that startpage.com has a link here on the first page or two of a 'robowaifu' search, so it will eventually lead you to whatever new bunker appears, even if it takes a few weeks for it to show up.
>Update: Well, it ''did''. Maybe Jewgle is delisting us now (a good thing tbh). On 8ch we used to be the number one hit on Bing for the same search, so they eventually should find wherever also.

C) And even if I myself disappear, I'm not in any way vital to this movement anon. In fact as I said in the Happy Birthday thread back on 8ch, I merely responded to what was an obvious need already happening. I kept waiting for someone else to do it but finally decided, "ehh, be the future you imagine" and founded /robowaifu/. Someone else can easily pick up the mantle if I myself disappear. In fact, I was planning to pass the board on to a new leader even before 8ch was taken down as I have a lot on my plate atm with Uni.

So, just stay calm and focus on learning how to create robowaifus and everything will be OK anon. Keeping a backup regroup thread such as the anon.cafe/cafe one is a good idea, but please don't try to incite panic, alright?

And to answer your specific question, Robi made it clear it was an issue with his NoSQL MongoDB setup. Most likely it was merely a technical glitch.

You need to calm down.

>I was concerned because I thought someone on /cow/ had done something to the wrong person and they were coming for JulayWorld.

/cow/ is a board of peace and doesn't attack anyone. They just archive autism. No one they archive is skilled enough to do anything to Julay anyway.

>It turns out it was just a technical error but I'm not entirely sure of specifics of what happened.

The database server crashed because Lynxchan isn't very good software and MongoDB isn't either. We're working on replacing them with something more stable but doing everything from scratch takes time so we'll be forced to limp along with what we have for awhile now.



Since opening Julay we've only had minor downtime twice. Downtime happens especially when something crashes while the only person that can restart it is asleep.

No problem. I should mention in the future you can always come to # julayworld on Rizon if something like this happens again.

Thanks guys. I'm sorry for my freakout. Things have just been so fucking tense. Make no fucking mistake, just because 8chan is down doesn't mean (((they))) won't stop coming after us. I also understand that you, Chobitsu, are not /robowaifu/. /robowaifu/ is more of an idea than anything else. But losing you would mean losing someone important to the movement. We not just be losing a you as a board owner but also a brother, a son, a teacher, and a father. National Socialism didn't die just because Hitler did. It's still alive and well.

/robowaifu/ would still be alive even if the ZOG kicked in your front door and executed you in your living room right now but I feel /robowaifu/ would be weaken.

I nonetheless appreciate your words of reassurance. 

Please don't give up your position as BO. If you need to take a break just make someone an admin.

but nobody knows the future for certain. everyone make sure that if the board ever does come up as claimable that one of you regulars here get it first and manage it with an even hand, remembering the long-term goals for the broader world. try to discuss it and come to an agreement between yourselves beforehand. if i ever show up again later, then the system here has an easy way to transfer ownership through the board's management page. 

but ''whatever'' happens, just don't let it fall into the hands of some socjus mental case who's only goal is literally to destroy the board. but even if that worst case ever happened, i imagine the administration here on julay will support you guys to boot out an evil asshole from control of the board. they value /robowaifu/ fairly highly afaict. simply build up a strong consensus and everyone approach them together, demanding a replacement.

anyway, in the meantime you guys just work hard learning the skills you need to make your own robowaifus and share it here with everyone. together we're all going to make it anons. :^)

If I messed up again, and he's announced the site is general-use ready, then I'm a double-idiot and deserve bullying.



That said, I really like it. Very easy to use, even for Tor/noscript users. Robi is working on another IB project too, I think, and there was another one still as well. Hopefully they also turn out much better than Lynxchan and Vichan did.

suitable for our purposes as a bunker-bunker. he's going to work closely with us to quickly do a dump of the board there if it ever becomes necessary as well.

# 190
So, in my conversation with Robi about migrating /robowaifu/ here to julay in a big data dump I began to work on a simple tool first that would allow me to archive the full board here live and give me some experience with julay's json api. I've gotten it knocked together in a tolerable fashion to my tastes so I thought I'd mention it here to see if anyone else had any interest in it. If so I can make a thread on it.

Be aware this isn't a 'packaged' program, it's just some code I wrote. I compiled and ran it on my own machine. It has several dependencies (pic 2 related) that have to be met as well before it will even build. But if you're someone who knows how to compile C++ and install developer dependency libraries and you'd like to see the tool, just let me know.

The current /robowaifu/ here is about 1'000 files and ~420 MBs. It takes my setup about 8 or 9 minutes to download the initial archive. But updated after that takes just seconds.

# 191

So is this board going to be reinstated on 8kun with their shared secret method of communicating with previous board owners?

https://twitter.com/infinitechan/status/1181796277392011265

# 195
>>1296
I'm both the original founder of /robowaifu/ and it's final BO on 8ch. I have the shared secret.

My original intent--operating under the presumption 8ch would be coming back up eventually--was to just scrape the board, delist it from their catalog, and put a link to the bunker here for the benefit of our previous community members who haven't found us yet. I would leave both boards active and that way everyone would (hopefully) be able to link back up.

Now that I'm aware that 8ch will ''not'' be coming back, I'm still undecided. My instinct is to wait and see what it's going to be like. If the Watkins intend to turn 8ch into a boomer-oriented enclave, then I think I'd prefer not to participate thanks. If it's going to maintain it's former spirit then yea, I'll probably proceed with my initial plan.

I'm open to hearing ideas on this anons.

# 196
>>1297
>intend to turn 8kun into*

# 197
>to turn 8ch into a boomer-oriented enclave

Traffic wise that was already the case for over a year thanks to the qanon phenomenon. The /qresearch/ board was unlisted so not many of the previous users have any idea just how big a part of the site it was, it was the biggest most popular board by far.



From what I've heard in several unrelated circles millions of dollars are being made off of this fad, some guy who made an app that updates when there's a new qanon post was getting tens of thousands of dollars per month back when it was at its prime. This is way bigger than the Anonymous craze of the late 2000's. Fredrick Brennan wants it all shut down and is so angry about all this because he sold out a goldmine for almost nothing. Almost all of tweets now are about qanon and his followers.



With the 2020 election season just starting Jim would have to be crazy to not focus his site on the lucrative boomer demographic. We'd all do the same.



On a /robowaifu/ note I'd say keep it here and eventually move to hosting your own imageboard dedicated to it. I'd like to see entire boards dedicated to the topics we discuss instead of single threads.

# 198
>>1299
Yea, I guess what you say makes some sense. I suppose what I'm really saying is that if the site turns into another version of 4cuck, filled with degenerate socjus mods and all the other trash that comes along with so-called 'polite' society these days. I'm concerned that if they try to overreach in this manner, to make it more accommodating to the boomers, then the entire thing will go to shit.

If they do, then I won't have anything to do with it. The challenge is that it will be tricky to ''remove'' the board from 8kun once it's established there.

# 199
>>1299
>I'd like to see entire boards dedicated to the topics we discuss instead of single threads.
You know, I'm inclined to agree with you anon. Certainly some of the engineering topics we discuss here could use an entire board dedicated to it. I like the way you think anon.

# 200
>>1301

I was looking at TLDs which would be suited for it and unfortunately .fu doesn't exist yet. For a novelty address there's .engineer and .engineering that are suitable but the registrar might be selective on who can purchase them to keep it exclusive. 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Internet_top-level_domains



With an alternative DNS system you could make .waifu but not many people would use it. Maybe get in touch with the admin of this site and ask about why he chose .world and where to purchase it for cheap. Plus the board software here works great, he might be able to help us set it up initially.



I'd volunteer as a moderator and contribute financially on the condition that the site takes a neutral political position regarding sexbots.

# 201
Why didn't 8ch had an archive like warosu, fireden, 4plebs, etc?

Also, this board is, unfortunatly, dead. An entire IB for /robowaifu/ would be overkill. We spend more time talking about building a robot waifu than building the thing itself, anyway.

# 202
>>1305

>Why didn't 8ch had an archive like warosu, fireden, 4plebs, etc? 

It did but it went with the rest of the database and it wasn't used very often. It's a good example of why it's best to archive things offsite and in multiple locations. So many boards are gone now that they've decided not to restore everything.

>An entire IB for /robowaifu/ would be overkill.

Every board should learn to operate their own imageboard if possible. With the webring the problem is solved of not every having new anons visit. Decentralized is for the best because if one board goes down it's easy to find out why through using the others in the ring. It prevents one place going down from taking everything else with it.

# 203
>>1305

I don't care if there's less than a dozen people involved as that's all it takes to get the ball rolling initially if they're the right people. Plus having been on IBs since 2004-5 I'm used to a slower pace where there can be a week or more before a reply.



>We spend more time talking about building a robot waifu than building the thing itself, anyway.

You've got 5-10 grand lying around to build a humanoid robot? Just motorizing a basic no frills TPE sex doll for basic movement starts at a grand.



A decade ago if you wanted a sex doll the only option was silicone and the price started at 7-8k w/ shipping. It's almost 1/10th that today. The same thing is going to happen with robotics but the pace will be much faster.

# 204
>the archives
>============
I have probably 95% of the board archived locally on my own machines. I scrambled that last day to get the latest versions, but unfortunately:
-I missed some of them in the rush before the entire site died completely. So, roughly 8 of the threads I only have the copies from the old archive.today archives.
-My download tool only grabbed imagefiles, so I have very few if any of the non-imagefiles like webms & pdfs. If the original posters cared to, they could repost those here for us at a later date.
But all in all, with the original board having > 5'500 posts, I feel fairly good about having retained at least 95% of that for everyone.

>the current bunker
>==================
I have re-OPd by hand 90 threads here and have methodically worked my way through repopulating the first 20 or so of them, working from the smallest towards the largest. According to my original plans, I would have continued with this effort until I had finished, but after my brief discussion with Robi about restoring the rest of the board here using a big data dump approach instead--and his stated willingness to do so--I've put off this tedious manual effort and have instead been focusing on writing software that will accommodate this migration effort. It's already working for the first phase of my plan for it, and I can already make full current backups of **~~any~~**the board extremely conveniently with it, and I keep them up to date now daily.

>the future board
>================
I don't really know what's going to happen in the future, ofc. ATP I'm uncomfortable 'officially' migrating /robowaifu/ to 8kun until I have a better feel for what they intend to do with the site. And it may take months of me observing them being in operation before I'd feel comfortable about it, after everything that's happened. I doubt I'm alone in these reservations, and I'm sure other BOs feel something similar. In the meantime, I intend to finish up the ArchBot software, and finally migrating the archives from the original board that I have on hand here to the Julay bunker. I probably will also fully populated the bunker-bunker on Fatchan at some point, the site Admin Tom there willing.

>  .  .  .

And as far as the other sentiments expressed about board traffic or general progress, heh, ''"be the future you imagine"'' is my motto. That's the only idea that motivated me when I started this board. And quite frankly while I thoroughly appreciate all the great input from all the guys over the years--I've learned so much here on /robowaifu/--I don't care if I'm the '''only''' individual doing this if necessary. I was alone when I created this board after all. I firmly believe in the value of robowaifus to men and to our culture, and I'm also fully convinced that they will in fact become real one day. I intend to be right in the middle of it when it's happening anons. :^)

Any chance you could share your ffmpeg settings for encoding files anon (assuming you did)?

# 209
>>1312

I did use ffmpeg to convert the .mov from speecys.com to .webm for here but I only used the basic conversion with no options. I thought about increasing the bitrate as motion was blurry but the still frames are detailed enough.

ffmpeg -i EDB+WP.MOV output.webm

# 210
>>1313
Thanks. It's always been on my bucket list to pick up using ffmpeg effectively. I'll look over the guide there and play around some. /robowaifu/ could use more videos tbh, especially atm.

# 211
>>1313

>>1314

The only thing out of date is that proper multi-thread encoding has been added in. So you'll want to use

```cpp
-frame-parallel 0 -tile-columns 0 -row-mt true -tile-rows 6```

-g 9999 can also make seeking a bitch and break it, and most guides I've looked up have said to use values of about 2-5 times the framerate. Since most video is ~30fps, I've been defaulting to -g 120.

# 212
>>1316
Alright thanks for the tips anon.

# 213

I meant ''-frame-parallel 1'', NOT 0. Embarrassing.

# 216

They're staying put in their bunker and delisting their board from 8kun. I wish we could keep all of our frens in one place but perhaps it's better we are splitting up. Our (((enemies))) now have more targets to shoot at. I find it a little bit funny that the bitch rainbow hair diversity hire that monitors /cuckquean/ will eventually end up becoming a /cuckquean/ herself. That's how psyops work, isn't it?

Hello anon, thanks for stopping in. This is only a partial migration (~20%) of the board from the old one, so eventually we should have the majority of the original content here.

Welcome back anon. We were wondering where you'd been! :^) The site admin here is cool af, his name's Robi. I think /robowaifu/ will do well here as long as Julay stays up tbh. Once I get the exporter phase of my project working for Lynxchan IBs, we'll be bringing over the rest of the loose file-pile backup of 8ch/robowaifu I have on my machines. We have ~20% of it ported here atm, plus some new stuff since we joined Julay ofc.

So, have any fresh ideas pop into your head about creating robowaifus during your break? I'm still tied up with things in life and can't put too much attention on my designs atm, but I'm still slowly improving my code-craft, so that will be helpful.

Well, thanks for letting us know you found us again anon. And I think we all hope for a productive future for /robowaifu/!

>In other news:
I've just discovered /templeos/ has been restored, such as it is **lots of file 404s :/**. I grabbed a Bump of it to my machine already, so I now have a local copy of all the available posts and media that are there atm. My guess is that's all that will be showing up on 8kun, actually.

I hope the original /templeos/ BO from 8ch will rebuild it on a bunker somewhere and that it will reacquire it's former community. Terry deserves a functional imageboard in his honor tbh.

Okay I'm a little drunk but hear me out. You have robot waifu right now, as in this very second. You do all the robot waifu stuff you (and she) has always wanted to do. You are perfect for each other because it was (quite literally) always meant to be this way.



You get older. She doesn't. This is absolutely not a drawback and of course she doesn't care.



But you get really old. She's now the one taking care of you when you're old. Eventually, you die.



...what the fuck happens to your waifu? Does she run when some kind of legal bullshit tries to state she is now the property of whoever the fuck? Do we have rouge robo waifus running around evading capture?

Thank you for the welcome, I haven't been active in this community, Yet? I am a very crude beginner artist with a robot girl character in the works. Maybe you guys will get to see her some day. 

I wanted to do robotics in college but college wasn't for me, anxiety.exe. Just a poorfag paddy farmer here, but I hope to one day build a waifu. Having the dream of a pretty robo companion to accompany me in public and wear nice clothes is a lot more of a certainty (with advancing robotics and machine learning) than a wahman relationship at this moment. Doesn't mean I'm going to stop looking for a qt 3d who will be my waifu. I'm sure a lot of you guy's idea of a perfect female partner is ok with you having a robo companion. 

Anyways I really look forward to this being our cozy place where we can discuss building beautiful machines.

# 244

We're glad you're here anon. I think we all share a common dream of having our own beautiful waifus one day. Artists are definitely one of the skilled anons we need here, and if you are interested in arts at all, then I'd suggest you submit your robot girl work in this thread:

Damn, I'm so glad this board still exists. I got caught up with life and thought this board was gone forever. It's fucking terrifying spending 98% of my time thinking about AI and robowaifus and when I search the internet there's just nothing, nobody I can relate with, only memes, ironic interest and lefty idiots who think someone else will do the work and hand the world's resources to them on a silver platter.



>>1307

>You've got 5-10 grand lying around to build a humanoid robot?

What can we even do with that much? I'm pretty sure I read the creator of Cocona Kosaka comment somewhere that developing her cost $180,000. And the 45-cm tall toy version is $9000 at retail price.



The money issue is what bothers me the most. China is aggressively funding engineers and startups in robotics and AI and we got fuck all to work with. We got maybe 8 years left until most of the traditional jobs are automated. I know that sounds crazy but we're on an exponential takeoff now where progress is happening faster than all predictions. Just this month we got MuZero that can play both board games and video games to a superhuman level, 1.2-trillion transistor chips, John Carmack leaving Oculus to work on AGI, DeepMind beating 99.8% of Starcraft 2 players, the GPT-2 1.5B-parameter model released, voices imitating CEOs being used in high-profile scams, more and more automated businesses in China. If we're getting on this rocket it's now or never.



I don't know how people can live so calmly. I'm so bothered by this I only sleep 3 hours a night. I feel like if I could comprehend what will unfold in the next 5 years I wouldn't be wasting another moment fantasizing whether my robowaifu will have pink nipples or LED lights and I wouldn't be writing blog posts like this to deal with my cabin fever. I don't know what the fuck to do. I'm just a poorfag with $1200 saved that can draw and program a bit with 2-3 hours of free time a day, but I'm placing all my chips in AI. I don't even care that 99.9% of my ideas have been shit. The 0.1% with promising results give me hope I'm onto something good and can do something with it.



What's exciting me the most is implementing reinforcement learning to optimize for novel rewards. It seems so damn obvious. If the brain optimized only for rewards every damn idiot on the planet would be a billionaire terraforming the galaxy, but no, we're stuck in dopamine loops, whacking our dicks off to some new drawing of 2B. Why? Our brains and memes haven't evolved to deal with environments that have so much novelty. Not to long ago our ancestors would've never even seen an ass so great in their entire lifetimes. And one pair of thicc thighs isn't enough for our brain. Oh no, it wants another and another, looking for the next pair that speaks to you in a way that you can't explain because there's something to it you don't understand but it still makes your peepee so big and hard.



And what's the purpose of this hypnotic trance? The brain is trying to maximize its ability to obtain the largest variety of rewards. Expected rewards are easily obtained, so why bother collecting them unless necessary? The brain goes on playing and trying to figure out how it was rewarded unexpectedly so it can master its breadth of experiences. That way it can robustly deal with any type of situation. But this has been a complete disaster for our primal brains. We're drowning in a sea of rewarding noise that has far outstripped our learning rate limit. Or maybe none of it works that way at all and it just makes sense to me because I'm schizophrenic, a little hallucinogenic, maybe took too much magic. I don't care anymore. I'll continue testing and report back how this broscience garbage garage AI really works. At least code doesn't lie to me. Fucking whores.

Don't forget motion planning tech, Anon. Big potential there.

# 257
>>1586

I'm right with you there. My estimations for how quickly AI will completely take over are ''extremely'' liberal. I honestly believe that we'll achieve full skynet within five years, and cheap robotics within ten. Advancements like AI that can drive cars and beat world champions at games like chess have been made years ago, and the pace of advancement keeps quickening to the point where it'll soon become exponential, if it hasn't already.

Now, I like AI. I want to work on it, and I want to be one of the guys who helped make waifus a part of skynet. Despite this, my mentally ill brain just isn't fucking built to handle this level of technology, even though I ''really'' want it to. I know that I should crack open some programming manuals and start working on my own AI system fortright. However, a combination of lack of time, inability to prioritize what time I do have, and general ineptitude have continued to forestall me. The higher functions of my brain are screaming at me to start the projects I have planned, and finish those I've already started **(am still working on alt history series pls no bulli)**, yet they are in a constant state of war against the ever persuasive primitive core of my brain which has allowed my family line to continue to the point where I have been wrought into existence. The result of all factors combined is a nigh-constant state of existential melancholy and cycles of sleep deprivation.

The only positive note is that pornography has lost its edge for me some time ago, my brain having unanimously ceased to percieve any continued reward from it. Unfortunately, my age-old habit of becoming enamoured with fictive works has remained strong, and will likely never cease, **especially given it once kept me from the noose. Honestly, I'm not sure I ''want'' to discard that habit for the very same reason**. While I know I would be better for channeling the immense amounts of energy I use for reading and introspection into AI development, I've yet to find a way to properly do so. As such, I've consigned myself to reading stories, pondering philosophy, and taking in enough stimulants to explode an elephants heart.

This eternal challenge, I presume, is one that all of us here face in some form or another. How do any of us overcome the oppressive vices of our primitive cores, and achieve the ends which we so desire, especially when there is no tangible reward in sight? Of course, there are many out there who have done just so, and would readily admonish us for our foolish nature. The more helpful among them would lay out, in no unclear terms, pathways for the achievement of this etherial greatness which we so seek. Indeed, many of them have even gone so far as to write out and publish entire books for this end. Yet, unfortunately, these efforts are nearly always halted by one timeless, ever-present truth: They are not you, or me, and we are not them. Were this not the case, only '''one''' self-help book would have been necessary for mankind to prosper. Instead, we have thousands such books, and nobody has achived self-actualization from reading them.



In summation, though together we stumble on the path to fulfillment, the power to walk is something we must each achieve alone. I pray you all find your happiness in this terrifying world of ours.

What potential do you see in motion planning tech? I don't know much about it yet. I can't even comprehend how Tomoaki Kasuga controls all the voltages and coordinates the momentum and torque in her body perfectly to move her limbs so smoothly.



I know a lot of interesting work has been done on natural animations but not so much I know of for giving robots an awareness of their bodies and generating 3D maps of the environment. For example, Tesla's autopilot fatally mistook a truck for a traffic sign because artificial neural networks are horrible at viewpoint invariance, although this has been partially solved by capsule networks that can at least recognize the pose of features.

Any chance you can break that down for newcomers? What does that lingo mean exactly?

# 260
>>1597

Convolutional neural networks used in image processing are spatially invariant which means that regardless of where a feature appears in the image it will detect it so long as it matches a specific filter. The problem with this is that the position of a feature in relation to other features becomes lost as it passes deeper and deeper into the network, some of the information is saved but most of the information is lost. It can cause the network to recognize a face in something no human being would see a face. To us it's important a mouth is below a nose and the eyes above a nose. This is the pose of the features but CNNs don't recognize it.



A capsule network preserves pose information by detecting it and passing it on but it's still not viewpoint invariant. If you show it an object from a viewpoint it hasn't been trained on, it will have trouble guessing what it is since ANNs have no cohesive cognition of objects. It's not understood yet how our brains recognize an object, beyond that slow-firing neurons are necessary for cognition to occur and ANNs are fundamentally unable to do this since they're matrix operations not action potential simulators.



A good video explaining capsule networks:

Looks like as soon as their board was properly restored and the owner announced the migration, one-line "no, let's stay!" posts appeared without other activity on the board. I don't understand it myself. I can understand being attached to 8chan, but 8kun isn't 8chan.



>>1300

>The challenge is that it will be tricky to remove the board from 8kun once it's established there.

Exactly. I fear that any boards that opted to be restored but who attempt to migrate away permanently will be seized by 8kun's staff and references to new locations removed. Many smaller boards are already fatally fractured.

# 268
>>1737
>one-line "no, let's stay!" posts appeared
That could partly be explained by shilling. In fact, given how typical effort-posts are in that board's community I'd say that's a pattern that glows from a mile away tbh. Certainly any women that really cared about it would write more than just one line.

# 269
>>1742

>I'd say that's a pattern that glows from a mile away tbh.

Looks like the board's been reset and recent posts no longer show up. I think it's like that on the whole site now, though.

# 270
>>1743
I see. Well, we wish /cuckquean/ well ofc. They are literally about the only sane women left in the West it would seem. And even apart from (((current events))) they would have been outstanding females in any age. Godspeed to them.

# 271
Hey /robowaifu/ engies,
We are currently streaming the group phase of the current year's 8chanCup (or as it's more properly known as the Infinity Cup) but due to the exodus and 8ch hiccups we've lost a few teams whose boards never really recovered.
Because of that, we thought it could be great if you guys could join us with a team of your own and participate in the next iteration of the cup, if you feel like it.
All you need to do is create a wiki entry of your own team over at http://infinitycup.shoutwiki.com/wiki/Main_Page (use the layout of other teams as a preset), coming up with members/players that represent your board's culture and in-jokes, create a proper emblem and jersey combo and optionally choose strategies, skills and exportable 3d models using the rules set up at http://infinitycup.shoutwiki.com/wiki/Rules and we'll make sure to consider your application for the future pot.

I should mention that we would also really appreciate if you came over to our cup's stream at https://cytu.be/r/8cup to spectate what the cup's really all about and to propose your own ideas to make it even better.
See you on the field!

# 272
Ah, I see, I should have posted it in here.

Sorry about that, still the invitation stands.

By the way, I recall you guys being really into the whole project and I wanted to take a peek at it but I never get the time to read all the threads, so how're you doing?

# 273
>>1783
We're plugging away steadily. This is a years-long process ofc.

# 274
>>1781

I'd be interested in participating to help publicize this board but I'm not too crazy about the affiliation with modern 8chan/8kun. Now if it were a competition for the boards on the webring that would be something.



Importing models as characters shouldn't be too hard since most of the popular choices are already available on the sites mentioned in here >>415 but they'll probably require some re-rigging after conversion to work in Blender. The logo I'd go with the crushed hand with gears warning sign. For kit, colors, anthem and goal horn no idea.



Where do you guys keep the videos of recent matches? The only ones I see on youtube are years old and for 4chan.

# 275
>>1784

Yeah, I figured, but I really wanna read what you guys are doing. You seem awfully passionate about it. I loved Pluto, that got me thinking about companion robots so much.

>I'm not too crazy about the affiliation with modern 8chan/8kun.

While the organizers use 8kun, the whole thing is more of an inter-imageboard competition. I don't think we're adopting the 8kun brand any time soon though, but we'll probably rebrand as Infinity Cup to make it sound more generic.

>Now if it were a competition for the boards on the webring that would be something. 

We're getting there. We know some communities hate Jim's guts and respect their position.

You're free to make any kind of addition to your team, so far as it abides to the rules of the tournament and the 3d models and export work it's fine by us.

>Where do you guys keep the videos of recent matches? 

The cytube has the link to the host's twitch, there SHOULD be at least the matches from this year's group stage, I think they changed the account for this edition, you'll need to ask for the older cups.

Thanks for the interest!

>Luke 2:1-20 New International Version (NIV)
>The Birth of Jesus
>2 In those days Caesar Augustus issued a decree that a census should be taken of the entire Roman world. 2 (This was the first census that took place while[a] Quirinius was governor of Syria.) 3 And everyone went to their own town to register.
>4 So Joseph also went up from the town of Nazareth in Galilee to Judea, to Bethlehem the town of David, because he belonged to the house and line of David. 5 He went there to register with Mary, who was pledged to be married to him and was expecting a child. 6 While they were there, the time came for the baby to be born, 7 and she gave birth to her firstborn, a son. She wrapped him in cloths and placed him in a manger, because there was no guest room available for them.
>8 And there were shepherds living out in the fields nearby, keeping watch over their flocks at night. 9 An angel of the Lord appeared to them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them, and they were terrified. 10 But the angel said to them, “Do not be afraid. I bring you good news that will cause great joy for all the people. 11 Today in the town of David a Savior has been born to you; he is the Messiah, the Lord. 12 This will be a sign to you: You will find a baby wrapped in cloths and lying in a manger.”
>13 Suddenly a great company of the heavenly host appeared with the angel, praising God and saying,
>14 “Glory to God in the highest heaven,
>    and on earth peace to those on whom his favor rests.”
>15 When the angels had left them and gone into heaven, the shepherds said to one another, “Let’s go to Bethlehem and see this thing that has happened, which the Lord has told us about.”
>16 So they hurried off and found Mary and Joseph, and the baby, who was lying in the manger. 17 When they had seen him, they spread the word concerning what had been told them about this child, 18 and all who heard it were amazed at what the shepherds said to them. 19 But Mary treasured up all these things and pondered them in her heart. 20 The shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all the things they had heard and seen, which were just as they had been told.

Merry Christmas. God's blessings on you this coming year, /robowaifu/.

Hey /robowaifu/. I've claimed this board as Chobitsu has been inactive for over two weeks and I don't want a bad actor to try to claim it. I've added Chobitsu as a board vol and whenever he comes back I'll give the board back to him. In the meantime I'll try to handle any problems if they come up.



Continue operations as normal. Good luck and godspeed.

# 281
>>1898

I appreciate you holding the board for us. In the case that chobitsu, for whatever reason doesn't come back, what will you do with the board? I really hope it doesn't come to that. Also, if it means anything chobitsu mentioned in the past that he doesn't want to be the BO of /robowaifu/ anymore, however he will carry on the mantle. 

Had you previously spoken to chobitsu before? I know that the administration staff had requested his presents on the /meta/ board.

**I'm the guy who you spoke to on /meta/ and rizon. I am speaking to euphoria, correct?**

# 282
>>1900

>I know that the administration staff had requested his presents on the /meta/ board.

I request him to come because I wanted to ask him to be a global vol. He did accept and has been one for at least two months now I think.

# 283
>>1901

Has he been active on his role a vol?

# 284
>>1902

I'd have to check the logs but it was very rarely probably because the others were taking care of things before he saw them. He hasn't been active since leaving two weeks ago. Board claims are based on last log-in to the account. I mostly wanted an extra set of eyes around to deal with global reports of CP and things of that nature. I asked him because I liked how he managed this board. Typically, when I'm looking for global vols I try to ask people that run their boards like he ran this one.

# 285
>>1900

>In the case that chobitsu, for whatever reason doesn't come back, what will you do with the board?

I suppose then I'll keep things running. I think he'll be back, don't worry.

Not personally, no.



>I'm the guy who you spoke to on /meta/ and rizon.

hey there, relax guys I'm alright. I've just been busy with things and have only rarely even been on the Internet for a few weeks. I've been focusing on studies and honing my skills to prep for work at jobs.

In fact here's a simple text-based maze game I've been working on to use for teaching other people C++ by making a project slightly bigger than just a trivial case. I plan to have it working by this weekend. Nothing fancy to look at **purposefully**, but it should be some reasonably solid code for basic casual game logic & mechanics. Hopefully someone else will take the time to learn from it.

I honestly didn't think you were ever coming back, good to see you. I was about to suggest I continue holding on to the board since you're busy, but you beat me to it.

it's so nice to see you again man. I was actually gone from the internet myself as I'm taking care of some person task that require a lot of time. Things have been really crazy. I'm glad to see you again, really. I can't overstate that enough. I was actually the one speaking about your status as MIA to the other boards. I told fatchan's /robowaifu/, /cuckquean/, and I think I brought it up to /monster/  as well. I really thought we had lost you and I wanted to memorialize you as much as possible. Even some of the guys from /fascist/ came over and gave us some encouragement. 

Anyways, thanks for coming back. I really feel a lot more comfortable now that you're here. I haven't been able to do any of my own programming due previously mentioned events taking place but after I am done, I'll see to it that it happens. Thanks for not killing over and dying. 



Also, a question to both euphoria and Chobitsu, who is the board owner now? I know that Euphoria said he'd hold the board as his own until Chobitsu got back so now that Chobitsu is back, is he the board owner? >>1939

There's a PDF about how to build one on the website (the parts you need, he said it would cost around $100 in total).  Other than that I think its a standard computer, just really small.  I don't really know what he does with it though.

From the Welcome to Robowaifu sticky:
>Note: This is generally a SFW board, given our engineering focus primarily. On-topic NSFW content is OK, but please spoiler it. There are some bizarre NSFW over at our friend's place https://smuglo.li/monster/ for those so inclined.

>Are robosluts welcome on /robowaifu/?
So, no, not really. We're very much ''not'' a porn board and are squarely in the SFW category. We used to be friends with /clang/, whose sole purpose was ecchi, the way we are with /monster/.

However, /clang/ has never reformed afaik. If you are posting actual project's works here (design, engineering, code, etc.), ie it's ''on topic'', and you're not just dumping text-porn, then in the spirit of hospitality we received from Julay itself I'm willing to give you a place here on /robowaifu/ at least until such a time as /clang/ reappears.

Create a thread specifically for your project and make your posts inside it. Please spell out in a non-lurid way some type of simple warning in the OP relating to the variance of the project from the norm here. I'll probably come along and edit the OP after-the-fact.

Note: the basic rules of not promoting feminism or literal faggotry outside The Lounge thread sill apply everywhere, including your thread. Spoiler all NSFW imagery. Please avoid lewd redtext to keep from drawing undue attention to it.

Good luck anon.

# 320
>>2265

Thanks, I'm thinking of making a thread on /hgg/ for players to try it out and a thread here for technical discussion of the project with instructions on fine-tuning it with other datasets. Since it's a SFW board I'll leave out the lewd model and make the lewd code optional to keep it focused on the actual design and code.



It'll be a few days before I make a thread yet. I still need to finish cleaning the code and let the model finish training. The test perplexity is at 27.8 and I'm aiming for 20.

Where are all the robowaifu devs? Are they all researchers too busy with their projects? Lex Fridman said on Joe Roegan's podcast his dream is to build a robowaifu. Drunk Elon Musk said he wants to build robowaifus. But if you look around online there are almost no hobbyists actively working towards them. I can't even find people really interested in AI. They're dabblers and people chasing meme degrees while society is on the brink of complete transformation. It's bizarre as fuck.

Well at the very least I'd say some artfags here should create some 2B banners and I'll put them up. Maybe he will actually stumble onto this place someday and help with funding. :^)

As for serious though? I don't think robowaifus are even on most normalfags radars Anon. That could change practically overnight if someone like Elon Musk publicly got behind it when he ''wasn't'' drunk.

# 324
>>2370

There is a general understanding that we are lacking the technology, particularly around AI. So what would a man who wants to make /robowaifu/s real do? Why, they would work on advancements in AI. And that's basically what is happening. Elon Musk for example is working on AI for self-driving cars, which hopefully will lead to some breakthroughs in robowaifu development. Likewise all these neural net image scalers, deepfakes, the new Microsoft flight simulator. These are all setting the scene for what we can only hope will be significant advances in AI in our time.



Right now we have the technology to make some really nice looking dolls. You can buy them for a few thousand dollars. But without the AI, they will just be dolls.

# 325
Not necessarily complaining but I don't get why you feel the need to manually move discussions over to other threads.

Hopefully it stays that way as long as possible. Normans aren't going to bring anything to the table. I'm just baffled because the internet use to be full of strange, amazing, talented people who didn't give a fuck what anyone thought. Now 4chan and glowchan are soulless shouting matches of who can yell obey and conform the loudest. They don't even enjoy their own shitposting.



>>2380

The software might not be there but the research is. If well-educated people started utilizing the bleeding edge in research right now they could make some amazing shit within a couple weeks or months of work. Researchers don't really bother with combining the latest developments that might have great economic or fun value because it doesn't really advance the field any further combining stuff that already exists. They're always pushing at the unknown. It's like how the internet was researched in the 1960's and didn't start seeing major development and public use until much later in the 1990's and still didn't become fully adopted until around 2016.



I'm hoping once I have a visual waifu that remembers conversations and has a voice synthesizer with emotions it will finally hit people over the head that there is a goldmine of research nobody is tapping into. And if that isn't enough I'll give her the ability to play SNES games or something. Maybe then we'll get some more skilled hobbyists working towards robowaifus.

Yes, I think most of us have a basic lack of imagination in general. Once something is obvious and right in front of us, then it hits us. One thing's for certain though, once pleasing robowaifus are viable, there will be an absolute avalanche of demand, in spite of actual laws passed trying to (((restrain))) it.

>>2416
> We are the robowaifu engineers now.
Heh, probably not too far from the truth Anon. :^) But things will turn around soon enough in that department once the ball starts rolling.

# 330
Almost done implementing a simplified MuZero-like algorithm in OpenAI gym. I'll make a thread with the source so people can tinker around with it and try to beat each other's scores. Lately I've been thinking that the best way to accelerate robowaifu dev would be to create engaging threads that keep everyone inspired to build, learn and create stuff.

# 331
>>2419
Sounds great, look forward to it Anon. And yes, motivation is a key factor to longevity. We are literally attempting to blaze a trail across a new frontier in our little corner of the world. This is never an easy thing, and teamwork is essential IMO. ''No One-man Armies'' heh. :^)

# 332
I've begun working on a ''Robowaifu Design Document'' as I discussed with Anon.
>>2396
>>2418
>>2420

ATM it's nothing more than a framework--''TBD''. I'm taking a break from it today, but I thought I'd go ahead and post the current in case I don't get back to it for a while so everyone can see where I'm going with it. I will be creating a pinned thread about it as well, and my intent is to go through and link relevant posts across the board inside each section of the thread's table of contents as a kind of hyperlink reference to /robowaifu/ itself.

Cheers.

# 333
Made some time to flesh out the subsection headings a bit more.

# 334
OK, so here is my first pass at integrating the IPCNet document into the larger document. There is much contained there, and many of these items have a larger scope than just the Software part of the manual it's currently located within. Therefore, broadening of the content's scope out to the hardware and operational aspects (EG, to be included inside the general ''Robowaifu User's Guide'' written at a later date) will be inevitable. A unified document and approach is going to be essential for such a large project. It will take some time of course.

Also, I hope my clumsy efforts at editing can be overlooked, and that everyone will make suggestions and comments for improvements. Please be patient, this is my first time writing a technical book **or any book at all for that matter :^)**.

# 335
I'm drawing a blank on the ''Design'' part of the design document, heh. :^) Anyone care to help out some suggestions here?

# 336
I figured out how to make codeblocks inside Latex that work well enough to be usable now. I plan on creating basic tutorials as appendices for the 3 programming languages Python, C++, & C for the Robowaifu Design Document.

# 337
Julay.world is shutting down. You guys already have a bunker on Fatchan so I presume you'll move there, but know that you've also got a standing invitation to anon.cafe since /cuckquean/ vouches for you.

# 338
So, I just found out about julay.world shutting down. I had been working on getting the software tutorial sections of the book together, but I'll probably refocus my efforts into helping Robi with MultiScraper instead for a while. So such as it is ATM, here's the latest rev of the Robowaifu Design Document.
>

>>2617
Thanks Admin. I'll have to check in with Tom and watnot to see what his plans are now. But thanks, yes at the least we'd probably like to setup a bunker there at anon.cafe.
>since /cuckquean/ vouches for you.
Heh, yea those girls are the best. :^)

# 339
>>2620

In the event that Julay doesn't keep this board around, are you planning on moving the full board onto fatchan or the cafe?

# 340
>>2622
Yes. 

It's obviously just a little too early yet to make strong assertions. As far as /robowaifu/ is concerned, we'll stay on nu-Julay if Robi intends to keep us around and migrate us to the new site. If not, then I'll talk with Tom over at Fatchan and discuss our orginal agreement from many months ago. anon.cafe has generously offered to open their doors to us. Finally, there are several other options available otherwise.

So if your real question is ''"Will /robowaifu/ close down?"'' the answer is no, I mean to do what's in my power to keep it going ofc. Things will sort themselves out Anon. :^)

# 341
>>2623

I never doubted that /robowaifu/ would stay up. Hell, if it really came down to it I'd shelter you guys on my board, and I'm sure others would extend the same offer to you.

**It must feel nice to be loved**



I just wanted to know where I should look for you guys first once the event horizon has passed. It makes sense that you would feel confident in keeping everything on here though, since you're already in good with Robi.

# 342
>>2628
Heh, thanks! It's the community here that makes us special. :^)

Yes, the plan has always been to regroup over at Fatchan if Julay ever went down. ATP I don't see a need to change that plan. BTW, Tom has been steadily going at it with JSChan. It's a real contender now in the ''Battle of IB software''.

# 343
>>2629

Not just special, but the kind of special that's good at making friends. ''Real'' friends. Your board and mine are the only two places on the web I even give a shit about anymore.



We've survived 8chan, so this should be a cake-walk in comparison **because at least this time we got some advance notice**. From one BO to another, I wish you the best, and as a user, I plan on sticking around no matter what.

# 344
>>2628
Thank you very kindly, Anon. What's your board? I'll put a link up if you'd like.

# 345
>>2629
>Yes, the plan has always been to regroup over at Fatchan if Julay ever went down. ATP I don't see a need to change that plan. 
Welp, we've gotten some bad news from Tom. Apparently fatchan has been deplatformed. I've put in a request at anon.cafe for a tentative bunker site.

==UPDATE:==
We've been given a place at anon.cafe, and our new bunker is now:
https://anon.cafe/robowaifu/
As before, we'll regroup at our bunker should the need arise.

==UPDATE 2:==
Robi plans on keeping /robowaifu/ on, so we'll be sticking around here as our home for the foreseeable future. The plan as always is to maintain a separate bunker which is at anon.cafe. Thanks for everyone's patience through this. Let's get back to those robowaifu studies! :^)

>>2658

You can set up encrypted group chats with https://tox.chat/ and tunnel the connections over Tor. Tox group bots are able to automatically invite users to group chats allowing for groups of people to connect and communicate using the group bot to host the chat without necessarily pre-sharing their Tox ID's:

https://github.com/JFreegman/ToxBot

Lex Fridman's Discord server separates different AI topics into different channels. We could probably do something similar with different group chats for each topic. It'd be fun to discuss research papers with people in a group but we don't really have that many people here yet.



>This topic is simply too controversial to be barebacking it.

I agree. People are laughing now at the thought of autists playing video games in their rooms with robotic dolls but they won't be once they start cooking, cleaning, teaching, and looking 10x prettier than any human being. Those who know what the future holds are already pissed and not necessarily about robowaifu:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVCEnIH56SY

They're openly discussing a first strike as the only solution. What a time to be alive that people will soon want to murder you for trying to play video games with a doll.



In my opinion we're gonna need a lot more man power though if we're gonna achieve robowaifus in our lifetimes. We have to lower the barrier to entry somehow and make it easy for people to get into building robowaifus and accessing things they wanna use, like Tox chat. I was thinking of setting up a server with MediaWiki on it so we don't have to worry about all our work being taken down and lost forever. Then we could collaborate on various tutorials and topics, dumping everything we know for others to use. People interested in topics on the wiki will naturally find it if it's useful and become involved here, instead of everyone smoldering along without any help trying to reinvent the wheel by themselves. It'll attract experienced people too. There are researchers and entrepreneurs who wanna build robowaifu but they don't have the time to study everything and get into the complexity of it. Making things easy is essential.



My dream is to create an online course where someone without any programming knowledge can learn the basics of Python and machine learning and know how to code their own visual waifu by the end of it that they can chat and play together with in OpenAI's retro gym. I think that would get a lot of people interested but that's at least 3-5 years away working on my own and I want a robowaifu right now.

# 347
>>2662

Good luck, Anon.  I wish you success.

# 349
>>2658
>https://tox.chat/
Thanks for the info. I remember looking into tox back in my shitposting days of yore, but iirc the need to create an ID turned me right off from it. I'll check back into it again, if as you say we can auto-invite participants with no need to specifically use their IDs during a chat.
>different AI topics into different channels
Yes. We are dealing with a literal plethora of different topics and issues here, and in fact we need many more sub-threads than we currently employ on /robowaifu/. So at the least the basic idea of multi-channels for a chat is a go tbh.
>People are laughing now at the thought of autists playing video games in their rooms with robotic dolls but they won't be once they start cooking, cleaning, teaching, and looking 10x prettier than any human being.
This. It's simply inevitable. The only question on the table is whether Anon will enjoy the freedom of privacy and whatever.the.fugg.he.wants. in his robowaifu, or if they will appear only via a corporate-police-state dystopia the likes of which will make ''1984'' look like a bright, optimistic essay about a /comfy/ stroll in the woods one Summer day. This is basically what we're fighting for here on /robowaifu/, and it's definitely a race against time.
>What a time to be alive that people will soon want to murder you for trying to play video games with a doll.
Topkek. That's a great way to put it Anon. Actually it's very encouraging tbh. :^)
>we're gonna need a lot more man power
Absolutely. In the meantime, we'll make due. Generating interest isn't my forte, but hopefully someone who can will do so at some point. All I can do is affirm that while I have the helm, I'll work to keep the board focused on it's basic mission and to fight anything I perceive as destructive to it or to us.
>I was thinking of setting up a server with MediaWiki on it so we don't have to worry about all our work being taken down and lost forever.
This is a great idea. Not so much because it's somehow invulnerable **it's not ofc** but b/c it's much easier to sort of regiment everything into an easily searchable & editable document that's much better organized than an imageboard tends to be. As far as durability is concerned, just like /robowaifu/ itself, I'll keep the thing completely archived and ready for migration. I learned my lesson after the 8ch debacle.
>Then we could collaborate on various tutorials and topics, dumping everything we know for others to use.
Please do so, yes.
>[without] everyone smoldering along without any help trying to reinvent the wheel by themselves. 
That's exactly what this whole thing is about tbh, helping Anon get his robowaifu as quickly as feasible.
>Making things easy is essential.
Probably. Certainly it will help out in a big way.
>My dream is to create an online course where someone without any programming knowledge can learn the basics of Python and machine learning and know how to code their own visual waifu by the end of it that they can chat and play together with in OpenAI's retro gym. 
That's quite similar to my dream as well Anon. This is an important idea behind the Robowaifu Design Document, and why I set apart sections in it for AI development in general, and Python, C++, and C programming in particular.

Great points Anon, I'm quite pleased with your inputs. And apologies about this text wall anons, but there are a lot of topics to address here.

>>2663
>>2664
Welcome Anons, please stick around.

# 350
Maybe we could advertise on MGTOW or incel communities.  Lots of STEM majors in those communities.  Or we could print fliers and post them on college campuses (when they open back up) around the STEM department.  Engineers are overwhelmingly male.

# 351
>>2669
Fine by me, and seems likely to at least have some modest success at improving participation here. However I would prefer it be made very clear by any such material or representative that this is ''not'' a MGTOW community. We're an artistic and engineering board with one very clear mission: '''Create Anon's first Robowaifu'''. Any other topics will be dissipation from this already highly-challenging task and we don't need that. I will actively move content promoting that kind of mindset into The Lounge, and I'd hope everyone here can help each other stay focused instead on our basic task, and to turn that energy into productive work towards '''like, just make robowaifu''' instead.

But other than that one stipulation towards manhood & focus, I'm agreeable with the basic plan. Think this is something you would pursue Anon?

# 352
BTW, we have now hit the autosage limit (350) in this thread and it's time for a meta-2 as it were. If you feel so inclined Anon, create a new one (link back to this one in the OP pls), or I can do it myself as need warrants.

# 353
>>2674

I'm not very artistic, but I could definitely put up fliers around my university once it opens back up.

For a free wiki we might be able to use the 'install gentoo' one that describes itself as 'the free wiki for various terrible imageboards.'. Two benefits of this board using that one would be in case this site gets taken down as the new address or temporary bunker will be easier to find and as a way to advertise this site to people involved or interested in imageboard culture.
https://wiki.installgentoo.com/wiki/Main_Page
At the very least someone ought to make an entry for /robowaifu/ on this page
https://wiki.installgentoo.com/wiki/Julay.World

A more practical short-term solution could be to run OpenBSD air-gapped or with a custom-made communication device and interface to another computer connected to the internet if absolutely necessary. There are hobbyist-made radio devices that have a 10-mile range that would be superior to using WiFi and higher bandwidth ones with a 1-mile range. I can't remember the name of the project but it was related to creating a mesh network during a sustained power grid failure. High bandwidth isn't really necessary and a hardware bottleneck would also provide a guarantee an attacker can't silently rsync 10 GB of your personal data off your robowaifu or open a video feed without being noticed. Software updates could be done with SD cards.

Moving forward things will probably start getting less friendly as more people find this board so be aware of who you're helping. If someone admits they don't really care about having a robowaifu but are making robowaifu-related things, don't ignore that detail, because it will be really important once that project is complete and achieves its true objective.

# 369
>>11986
>They're going to do their evil regardless of us. Our agenda is simply to outpace them and get it broadcast far-and-wide first.

I am not sure why, but it seems this board has been catching extra attention lately from outsiders. Maybe it's just a few posters talking a lot... Hopefully it's not 3 letter agencies, or "secret" groups trying to create internal strife. It's textbook PsyOps. Or maybe it's because people are sharing it...
I worry that at some point GlowAnon's hire legal experts/lawyers in an attempt to throw the board into chaos with accusations of "someone here stole my work!".

But you're absolutely right. We need to outpace them and get it out there first.
It is clear that there are hostile entities roaming this board, as evidenced by what was going on in the "step by step" thread.
The only real way to speed things up is probably going to be thru a cut-throat company willing-to/forcing people to keep up.
<I just question if it's possible to opensource such a company.
Perhaps, a type of biological "bitmining", where money is earned based off the calculations/code/contributions uploaded to the company's database from users.
Early on it wouldn't be a good business model to pay money for random bits of information, so maybe it might be better to pay in the form of recognition or perhaps through a game and assets in the game.
In a sense, the company would be "non-profit" (501 c 6 non-profit organization) or something that the community builds upon that prevents random companies throwing money around to shut us down.
<Perhaps, everyone should be pointed to a thread that explains how to go about declaring an opensource license and making sure no one "accidentally" incorporates closed source software/hardware/designs.

Simply put, we're probably going to need some sort of leader.
Maybe make our own OS (linux-distro) that specifically is for robowaifus.

The linux foundation is backed by "hostile" big tech companies that originally hated the idea of opensource.
>https://www.linuxfoundation.org/join/members
Then as others have noted,
>"[Linux] was an alternative model for how to proceed here that was viable and in some ways more viable."
>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BnIuK0bV_7s
 (I think the full video is a good watch)

Also, I think the board could use some more categorization for organization purposes.
For example, we know what we are taught at the colleges/universities that "robotics" consists of;
>Software engineering
>Computer/Electrical engineering
>Mechanical engineering
These three topics perhaps could have it's own sub-threads, because right now it seems all of it is just mashed into the catalog.

We also know that the common languages for robotics used in the real world are;
>C
>C++
>Python
>Matlab
(I know threads for these already exist, but I am saying perhaps have original posts that can be updated for efficiency purposes.)

New people to the board don't know where to go or start, and there is too much too read, and I think many probably just find the "robowaifus in media" thread and never end up going anywhere.
Some of these threads probably deserve to be in a "/b/" type area, but maybe it would be bad idk.

If we look to our recent history, we know Linus Torvalds did most of the work on his own, but eventually started using "bitkeeper" but eventually made "git".
Now recently, supposedly trannies took over github so we obviously should maybe study that a little to figure out how to prevent something similar from happening again. Or just make make or find another type of "github" that uses git.
TBH I don't have enough know how to get anything setup this year. But perhaps I can skip a semester this fall and I can start working on a distro that is lightweight that can work as a starting point. Something slightly user friendly, but also an OS that makes it easy to install all things robowaifu.
Then maybe hire someone, or try to set up some sort of "git" for artists to get a "Mascot-Chan" for the OS/distro.
I could order some chinese knock-off smartphones where we install this distro on and try to generate some revenue to get something going.
I also know of a place where there is cheap land that is nearby a tier 1 ISP that we could maybe connect to.
The end goal will be an opensource OS that has a "talkative" AI, a digital body, and the user friendly capabilities of installing and controlling physical/tangible robots.
All improved by a community who "donates" work in exchange for either a digital currency, or digital credits with the company that can be used to buy physical/digital things.

All for the sake of shutting out predatory companies that ultimately want control.

# 377
>>13903
are you clinically retarded or just fucking illiterate 
c isnt a low level language, you cannot just fucking compile a high level language into another high level language, theres no syntactic mapping or correlation between high level languages only low level thats why theyre called low level languages, this wouldnt even be called compiling, its transliteration, compiling literally means building assembly( which for the clueless like you is another word for symbolic machinecode ), the assembler turns it to object code and the linker turns it to binary code, transliterating is completely pointless, you cant execute c code on a machine only binary code

bytecode has nothing to do with compilers or c or machinecode, bytecode is the shorthand instructions for interpreted languages, it runs inside a software interpreter ( like python ( written in c ) ), not the actual hardware of the machine, the fact that you conflate everything shows how little you know, c isnt even difficult to write, youre acting like its some kind of superhuman task to write c, if it was it wouldnt have stayed the dominant language for ~50 years with the vast majority of software being entirely written in c/c--

# 378
>>13856
are you fucking retarded or do you think I am, do you even know assembly, clearly not otherwise  you would clearly see all this tomfoolery is just to update the base pointer, %rbp which is calculated in a series of retard steps that I can only assume is stackwalking for a free allocation, why isnt the stack pointer on the stack to begin with, why the fuck isnt base pointner being pushed before changing? why the fuck is it done like this? why isnt the offset being maintained?  because its all pointless because you are a retard and youre not allocating memory yourself, the compiler HAS to do shit like this because you are a fucking retard

and exactly, THE ONLY WAY to make crust usable is to fucking disabled everything that makes it fucking different from c, fucking prefix everything with "unsafe" and compile without the retard garbage collector or debugger or whatever they call their shitty bloat they pack into the binary, basically just write fucking c in crust

# 379
>>13848
makes no difference, look at this ruffle code that has already been optimized, notice the hundreds of comparisons made before a single fucking jump and how much shit gets wasted on figuring out the stack pointer, why? because youre a fucking retard and crust treats you like one "muh null dereference prevention" yeah fuck you, this is what makes ruffle slower than fucking flash, no one thought that was even possible, how could you possibly get any slower than actionscript, crust thats how, what a joke

Is this the part where we find out he was a glownigger all along after ditching his “derpy animatronic”?

Is this the beginning of the arc when Sophiedev becomes a hysterical lolcow and comes back after she inevitably cheats and leaves him in “muh divorce court?”

The fact he’s larping so hard as a nazi christfag and saying shit such as :

I already showed the response algorithm from the fucking source code and the database it pulls words from you idiot, here are more of them, theres no fucking machine learning you naive liar, its just changing the algorithm for pulling responses by bumping the same words you input and adding a multiplier to get biased matches, temperature  is the fake """""""""""emotion""""""""" multiplier for preprogramed responses all of which are pulled from a preexisting database ( which YOU change by typing words  ),  it clearly has no fucking neural network code or even pointer allocations in memory ( impossible in python ), a neural network in python is literally impossible

I think that really goes against the core idea of /robowaifu/ outlined in "Why Robowaifu?" >>3 we're not really trying to create sentient beings here.

I'm reminded of a conversation I had elsewhere with some imbecile who must have played Mega Man Legends too many times, because he was far less interested in making practical robots to serve humanity than he was with some stupid doomer notion that humanity is going to wipe itself out real soon, so we should try to develop highly human-like AI for robots as a sort of 'successor' to humanity. Even if you don't think that's a painfully stupid concept, it's clearly not the intent of an imageboard called /robowaifu/ where one of two stickied threads compare the project to a sex doll and a Furby and the other thread is a catalog.

After the whole sell-out fiasco from a few months back, I guess we should of saw this coming.


>>13798
The board is probably compromised at this point.
As with all chans, anybody dropping their guard is simply naive.
We could try to investigate if any overt raids are being carried out, but I got a feeling it's time to save any potentially good info/ideas and be careful as what is written and who is watching.

Originally, this board was trying to give off the impression that it was "tame", but after the whole "em elle e" thing with some of his group/employees coming in acting as literal shills demeaning open source production speeds and with Chobitsu moving and deleting posts, everything has been hostile since then.

We know this is classic divide and conquer tactics.

Why? How? Do you hate yourself?
>interesting concept has a way to plan designs and has a mold
Has a mold? I don't know what this is supposed to mean. I can't take it as a mold for anything, until it is treated to make it stiffer.

Imho the whole papercraft waifu idea might be useful as a concept to build very simple waifus models, which are then modeled in some CAD program for printing and painting. Imagine the ones in the first posting here >>271 made out of plastics, while the hair would rather be TPU instead of something stiffer. Or cut out from some silicone rubber sheet. The parts could be made out of different plastics, some could be folded after printing, btw. Other parts, like the cheeks, could be painted. The Madoka Kaname doll also looks like something that begs for some rollers under the legs.

its not just a single larp, its several layers of larping each one building on the former, its the standard behavior of schizophrenics to get lost in their own fantasies and take their escapist coping mechanisms to inordinate extremes but sophiecringe is somewhat unique because I've been trying to figure out what kind of trauma hes suffering from to become this disillusioned with reality, its not just his larp lasagna, its something else that I cant put my finger on
