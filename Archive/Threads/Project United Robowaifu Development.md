In this thread, multiple users volunteer to work together towards a shared goal of creating a robowaifu for production. This can be an open source or closed source project, that is up to the Anons who volunteer. Profits will be divided up after a waifu is selling. I am putting every cent I have towards prototyping and manufacturing of this waifu. I cannot afford to pay anyone. Please understand this is a volunteer project with potential for a return on investment but no guarantee. Only thing guaranteed is one Anon at the very least will be working towards a waifu for production. 

Current plan for this waifu:
Height: 1 to 1.5 meter
Weight: As low as possible.
Battery Life: Ideally 16 hours for a full day of use before needing to recharge.
Physical Capabilities: A minimum of, sitting, standing, walking, laying down, and hugging her Anon.
Visual Capabilities: A minimum of being able to follow basic shapes, colors, and markers. Ideally capable of detecting her Anon and following him without need of a leash.
Auditory Capabilities: Capable of hearing and acting upon her Anons words after hearing her name. (Prevents her from acting unless you want her to.) Capable of responding with basic linguistic responses which ideally change over time.
