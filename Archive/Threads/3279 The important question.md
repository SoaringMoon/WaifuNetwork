Vagoo. I can't speak for anyone but myself but I'd like to get.. intimate with my fembot. I'd like to know what my options are for her robopussy. I was thinking something like a flesh light with sensors that triggers voice and arm action. I'm using Myrobotlab is Anyone familiar with it?

Robosex general I guess

I envision replaceable onahole cartridges will become a normal feature for robowaifus anon. Hopefully the industry will standardize them into a few open designs, so we don't get some shitty Google-esque lock in when we need a new vagoo cartridge for her.

# 3
I can imagine a robovagoo that has the inner, disposable, hypoallergenic lining surrounded by a series of grippers designed somewhat like pic related, that would synchronously activate in timed sequence together to produce an incredibly powerful **snapper-pussy** effect.

That's not quite it. You need something that can constrict and tighten. Perhaps a series of those, arranged in a circle would do the trick.

Probably the top-flight onahole (afaict)
Meiko ZXY

fitted to a pelvic section w/ a detachable plate. Ship the doll w/o a vagoo, and enable Anon to install his own at this discretion.

Simple & easy; you aren't offering anon a sex-doll, and he is simply ordering an add-on that's ancillary to the basic cute dress-up doll RW LLC is offering.

# 11
While it's probably important to be able to switch out the vagina, I think it's important to be able to switch out any part. One thing I think would minimize the need to switch out the vagina would be a self cleaning function. A way to flush water through the vagina to clean it that way. A small bladder that can be filled and then expelled with enough force to clean. Then instead of having to manually clean it every time, you could just sit it on the toilet and have it pee. I hear cleaning onaholes and fleshlights is one of the worst parts about them, so anything to minimize that seems important.

# 12
>>890
A series of narrow bands similar to what's on pressure monitors that use air pressure would be a lot simpler and cheaper, I've seen wrist models that sell for around $15. It's used here [[1980

>>898
Cleaning them shouldn't be an issue if they're removable and you've got 2 or 3 of them as they need to dry out before use or mold can grow in it. And I've heard the same about them, those disposable tenga eggs exist for that reason.

# 13
We as the Robowaifu Federation should probably come up with a standardized receptacle size so that we can mail onahole manufacturers one set of specs and they can come up with various models that can fit into our various waifubots.

Right now I think we're going for 80cm and 150cm bots.  The actual hole won't differ much (the one for the smaller bot will take up more of her torso though), but the insertable area will be limited.  Plus we need something like USB connectivity for heating / LED backlighting / servo motors (if you guys are willing to risk your dicks testing).

# 14
>>900
Size is important. We need larger models for more well-endowed men **like me** to properly enjoy. One size will not fit all.

# 15
>>901
I'm referring to receptacle size, a cylindrical area that should be standardized across all waifubots of a certain height. The hole that you fuck can be of various widths and depths, it is up to the onahole manufacturers to propose various models.  Regardless of which robowaifu we make we still have the widest range of vagina types to choose from. 

It's like we are the IEEE specifying the USB protocol so that electronic devices can communicate with each other without frying each other's electronics.  In this case we are coming up with robowaifu standards.

# 16
>>902
Oh, okay. My apologies, I misunderstood.
A standard port for synthetic vaginas actually sounds like a great idea. Anyone could upgrade to the latest model without having to switch out his waifu, too.
''Coming soon, the maelstrom 9000; now with even more spinning parts! You'll go from zero to nutting your dick inside out in 10 seconds or less guaranteed! Plus it'll still work with all current models of waifu, no adapters necessary! Visit our website for more details''

# 17
>>903
Yup, yup, yup!  We can have everything from disposable vaginas (like fucking a virgin every time) to high tech vagina modules costing more than the waifu herself.

# 18
>>904
I would get the super high-end one, and acquire schematics of it that I can then whip out and show to anyone who says that my waifu is inferior to a 3DPD.

I propose hymens

# 21
>>907
That would be wonderful imo. I believe it was FluffyDev mentioned throwaway foam ones, maybe those have them.

Does anyone know of onaholes complete with hymens? Even if it was only one-time just like real life it would be a nice touch to the ceremony with a new robowaifu.

# 22
Vibrating roboginas could have hundreds of small artificial muscles looped around inside them, allowing them to rhythmically massage you and lock you balls deep inside them when you're about to cum.

>>1609



They could also have high-resolution pressure sensitivity in three dimensions to know exactly what makes your peepee feel good.

>>1623



The desires and emotions of robowaifus will eventually be fully programmable and editable. You'll be able to make your robowaifu crazy for you at the drop of a command or make her teasing or shy, whatever you want. She'll watch and analyze everything you do and learn how to moan and writhe perfectly in ways that completely break your mind.



A cheap solution you could rig up in the meantime is some simple haptic sensitivity and a mic recording your breathing. Train a neural network to detect your moans off the focking data and have her play moans or generated moans. The hottest part of sex is being in sync, breathing together, moaning together, cumming together, bonded together like one being, man and machine. Once she starts moaning from things that make you feel good it'll drive you insane.

# 23
Some guy on the doll forums just showed off his new 3d printed DIY insert that is the most advanced and feature complete I've seen yet

https://dollforum.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=6&t=123084

See this mold? Combined with air muscles you could have varying tightness and pumping action that would work with the lubrication system.



And I had the same idea as him using those sodium acetate heating packs for heat generation in a very small area. My design would use the contents of several packs sealed in a torus shaped sleeve.

# 24

>I've embarked upon my quest to create my own custom PERFECT PUFFY PUSSY!!

>YES!! a SELF LUBRICATING and SELF HEATED Pussy!!

The absolute mad man. We need more people like this.



>I'm hoping that this might catch the attention of manufacturers and they'll put more emphasis on this. Everyone is so focused on robotics and AI and such. Someone needs to focus on the basics; things they've not finished getting right. For me, that's starts with good sex mechanics.

As crazy as I am for robotics and AI he's got a damn point. I think I can rig up a hand-pumped hydraulic system that sheaths around one of these pussy prototypes. A specially designed bag wrapped in some canvas to protect it from bursting will do. No plugging shit in, just pump the lever to the perfect tightness, take the hose off and ram your dick into a hot wet heaven.

# 25
Why have a robopussy when you can have a robopussy, roboass, and a robomouth and probably even more than that? If I had a robowaifu, I would roboanally roboimpregnate the robobitch and have plenty of robofun besides.

Turd Flinging Monkey (TFM), showcased the "spinning robot pussy" a while back. He argues it's better than the real thing because of the spinning action.

There's actually another really important issue that I learnt about when I got my first fleshlight, cleaning. Cleaning is a must (nasty things can grow otherwise), and that's why it's common for sex dolls to have removable inserts (washing the entire body every time would be a pain).
Without self-cleaning (and perhaps occasional manual intervention ;) ) it'd be a pain for most guys, although I also hear a lot of doll owners find cleaning their dolls therapeutic.
A chap on the doll forum has an interesting contraption:
https://dollforum.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=6&t=129802&sid=e7ffedc17e5f2ce5bb7c1906b948b5ca
Still a lot of work but a step in the right direction.

# 29
>>4701

I use a condom + enema with my doll. Works well enough to minimize the cleaning effort.

# 30
>>4740
Interesting. Yeah that is likely good enough for day-to-day cleaning (though you'll still probably need to clean the whole doll once a month?).
It would probably irritate me if I don't clean a doll thoroughly after every intercourse though.

# 31
>>4701

Been thinking nasal irrigation devices could be inspiration for a commercial cleaner. Maybe designed to use air pressure to push the water through instead of pumps, letting it blow dry once the water is emptied.

However I'm a big fan of a naval plug that can be accessed for flushing the system too.

# 32
>>6504
It's not a bad idea Anon. In my view, having a easily removable, replaceable onahole cartridge that snaps into place is probably the best approach economically that allows you to maintain good sanitary cleanliness and durability.

Anything we can do at this stage to reduce complexity will help get robowaifus out to more men.

# 33
>>6504

This. Removable is fine, but disposable seems like a problem, since it's a constant cost. Making them easy to clean is essential, and this seems like an easy and logical solution.

# 34
>>8120
I'd say like most everything else in a robowaifu, her vagoo should probably be designed for both easy maintenance (cleaning in this case), and repair (replacement with a new one in this case).

# 35
>>4701
Glad to see that cleaning is a topic that's already being discussed.

>>6504
It's pretty funny to see this, because a while back I had the idea of making all the holes connected so they could easily be cleaned all at once. Instead of using a "naval plug" I was literally just going to blast soapy water up her nose and out her pussy and ass. That's silly enough, but the idea of it blow-drying is just... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsdKrjee2yE

# 36
One of the most appealing aspects of a robowaifu to me is the idea that during coitus she could do any number of things to my dick that are biologically impossible. Her secretions could be made of nourishing essential oils that hyperstimulate bloodflow to the penis and her pussygrip could massage the penis in such a way that it could increase in size (see Angion method on youtube for a description of the manual function needed to make this happen). 
The robowaifu could also tell you how well you fucked her using any number of criteria. She could train you to increase sexual stamina or time until ejaculation. 

I wouldn't want my robowaifu critiquing my performance at all times but in general i think it plays to the strength of the robowaifu if she does things entirely differently than her human counterparts. 

Imagine going on a date with a flesh and blood roastie and you drop that your ex was a gynoid. "Holy shit this guy must know how to fuck like fucking Zeus then!" she thinks. 
Similarly, "male" sexbots could train biowomen on how to give better head, act sexier, etc.

Thoughts?

# 37
Let's also not forget that the robowaifu could also learn your preferences inside and out and then act in conjunction with a biowoman to realize them.

# 38
Thanks for your input. We already have a thread for this topic: >>419 - it should be moved over there by some mod.
On the topic: There seem to be channels dedicated to male sextoys on some alternative platforms to YouTube. The MGTOW 'Turd Flinging Monkey' seems to have one. These might show some thing which ar possible. Though, to put any of this into a robowaifu, we first need to make progress in building them.

# 39
Sex will be an important part of robowaifus for the majority of us OP. Techniques should definitely be something she could potentially master, given all the large amounts of attention we'll ''already'' be paying to kinematics, dynamics, and other motion-based studies. Good thinking.

However, we are  a SFW board in general, and I'm planning to merge your thread with our ''Vagoo'' thread very soon. (>>419)

# 40
>>13305
The thread merge destroyed my post as I was almost done writing it, and I'm not writing it all over again, so here's a TL;DR version:

1. A fucking machine could measure your performance, combining it with a waifubot seems pointless or even counter-productive if you want to see what diet and lifestyle changes could improve your health and performance in bed, unless you just want it to lay there like a cold fish and take it. I'd rather a waifubot be more interactive.

2. There's been shit like the Angion method since the internet started, so I'm not going to look into it further because I don't want that shit in my youtube history, which is where all of the info seems to be. That's a big red flag. If there's a list of essential oils, please post it. At the very least, some of it might make for good lube.

# 41
>>13341
My apologies about the timing, it certainly wasn't something intended to screw your posting up, thanks for taking the time to >tl;dr it again. That thread should never have been created here in the first place.

# 42

That's alright. I know you didn't meant to. And I do have the tendency to write too much, so it's probably for the best.

# 43
>>13341

Robowaifus are supposed to be able to see and ask if you are okay when you look unwell anon.

# 44
>>13350
That's well and good for a robowaifu, but most of the goals for making one are really lofty and would take a lot of time before any of us can get one that does even a fraction of the things we want. A simpler, dedicated machine is more obtainable. I'm talking about just something that you fuck, it collects data on everything from your stamina, how often you fuck it, to your semen quality and quantity, and more, then adjusting things like your diet/supplements, exercise routine or other simple things to see how they can impact that data. Something like that is hard, but still simpler than a good robowaifu, and trying to combine it with one just seems like it'd be a mistake.

A robowaifu might be able to make you feel better about your performance, but I can't imagine how one would actually help to make you actually perform better. At least when we're talking about technology that's easily available today.

# 45
>>13352
Never considered that and I'm also not interested. Why would I need to increase my performance? Why? What for? Why? Also, it is more difficult to build, probably difficult to even have a scientific foundation for it, and just a very special use case.

# 46
>>13354

anon is just being a coomer. silly derail and it feels like we've had a few of those in the last week suddenly. But, there's some benefit of the doubt since we're not always 100% OT - being a coomer is discouraged on '''this''' board (other than maybe basement lounge >>39  )

# 47
>>13358
I wondered about your statement and looked up the definition, and still don't get why you wrote that. Coomers have nothing to do with performance or getting bigger penises. Make more sense if someone would still want to date or getting female validation. 
I don't accuse other anons of things, just point out that his goals might be very peculiar to most of us.

# 48
>>13361

>re: Coomer

In certain online circles the term is a person who makes masturbation or the pursuit of sexual activity the main, or only focus of their lives. Granted there's going to be some overlap in here b/c presumably fucking robots is baked into the pie already and with that comes the doll enthusiasts, etc. That being said, I'm sure a standalone programmable machine with a hole in it would be a better "dick trainer" than a robot waifu. Either way, I'm not personally judging you but it's maybe an offshoot of "sexual technologies" more than an essential for a waifu.

# 49
>>13354

>Why would I need to increase my performance? Why? What for? Why?
In my mid 20's my stamina was gone, orgasms barely felt like anything, barely any sex drive, barely any semen, a hard time getting or keeping an erection. Doctors literally didn't seem to care when I complained about it, and I went to a few, and each recommended completely different unrelated medications. The only one that seems even close to making sense was for high cholesterol. Your performance is a very good indicator of your health. If you have no testosterone, not only are you going to be shit in bed, but mentally you're going to be fucking miserable.

>Also, it is more difficult to build, probably difficult to even have a scientific foundation for it, and just a very special use case.
No, if anything it's easier to build. It'd basically just be a fleshlight with sensors for collecting data. Then someone with far better understanding of math than I, would use that data with other bits of information about taking supplements, or time spent lifting, the temperature you shower at, or whatever, and find what's better and what's just retarded broscience. (like the shower thing)

Like I said, I don't see a point in combining the idea with a robowaifu, since unless it just lays there lifelessly, the data would be useless.

# 50
>>13368

sounds like a bad hormonal imbalance. Supplements, getting enough sleep, cutting back on alcohol and caffiene, eating more saturated fat and substantially less sugar and getting proper sunlight and exercise will fix all this. Barring something medically catastrophic I'd say you were victim of the urban/postmodern lifestyle. Sexual function is an indicator not a cause. have you fixed this since then?
