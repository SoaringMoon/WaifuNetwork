# About the Archive
The archive is a collection of unprocessed text and images that contain information that needs to be [[!HOME Distillery|distilled]]. After a file has been processed for its useful information, it is moved to the [[!HOME Ripped|Ripped]] folder. In this database, that is a thread's end of life.

After all information in the archive is processed, the Ripped file will be compressed removed from Obsidian to exist only as a backup.
