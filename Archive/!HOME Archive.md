# About the Archive
The archive is a collection of unprocessed text and images that contain information that needs to be [[!HOME Distillery|distilled]]. After a file has been processed for its useful information, it is moved to the [[!HOME Ripped|Ripped]] folder. In this database, that is a thread's end of life.

After all information in the archive is processed, the Ripped file will be compressed removed from Obsidian to exist only as a backup.

# Newly Posted Content
The archive will not store new posts in real time unless they are added retroactively by editing archived or ripped files. As such, they will be distilled as they are acquired afte the initial rip is processed.
